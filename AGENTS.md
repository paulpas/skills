## Overview

### What Skills Are

A **skill** is a self-contained Markdown document that injects specialized behavior, knowledge, and constraints into an OpenCode AI agent session. When loaded, the skill's full content becomes part of the model's active context, shaping how it responds to the current task.

Skills enable auto-routing: when the skill-router detects trigger keywords in conversation, the appropriate skill is automatically loaded and injected into context — no manual `/skill` commands required.

### How Skills Are Used

OpenCode loads skills in two ways:

| Loading Mode | Mechanism | When It Fires |
|---|---|---|
| **Manual** | User runs `/skill <name>` | Explicitly requested |
| **Auto-load** | `metadata.triggers` keyword match | Detected in conversation context |

**Auto-loading flow:**

```
User message contains trigger keyword
        ↓
OpenCode scans metadata.triggers fields of all installed skills
        ↓
Match found → skill content injected into context
        ↓
Model reads skill and applies its constraints
```

**Current Statistics:**
- **593 skills** across 8 domains
- **8 domain categories**: agent (230), cncf (171), coding (82), go (12), linux (10), programming (4), trading (83), writing (1)

---

## Domain Categories

Each domain has a prefix and default metadata values:

| Domain | Category | Default Role | Default Scope | Default Output Format |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agent` | AI agent orchestration patterns | `orchestration` | `orchestration` | `analysis` |
| `cncf` | CNCF cloud-native projects | `reference` | `infrastructure` | `manifests` |
| `coding` | Software engineering patterns | `implementation` | `implementation` | `code` |
| `go` | Go language-specific patterns | `implementation` | `implementation` | `code` |
| `linux` | Linux OS-specific patterns | `reference` | `infrastructure` | `code` |
| `programming` | CS fundamentals, algorithms | `reference` | `implementation` | `code` |
| `trading` | Algorithmic trading implementation | `implementation` | `implementation` | `code` |
| `writing` | Technical writing patterns | `reference` | `infrastructure` | `report` |

**Note:** These defaults can be overridden for specific skills that don't fit the typical pattern.

---

## Zero-Tolerance Stub Policy

**Creating a stub skill is prohibited.** A stub is a skill with generic placeholder content that provides no domain expertise. Stubs corrupt the router index and actively harm AI performance.

### Immediate Rejection Criteria

A skill is rejected if ANY of the following are true:

1. File contains: `Implementing this specific pattern or feature` → **STUB SENTINEL — DELETE**
2. File is under 3,000 bytes of content → **TOO THIN — EXPAND OR DON'T CREATE**
3. Core Workflow has generic steps like "Identify use case → Apply pattern → Validate" → **STUB — REWRITE**
4. Implementation skill has zero code examples → **INCOMPLETE — ADD CODE**
5. `metadata.triggers` contains only generic words (`code`, `data`, `risk`, `pattern`) → **TOO BROAD — SHARPEN**

### What to Do Instead

| You want to... | Don't... | Do... |
|---|---|---|
| Create a skill quickly | Generate a stub template | Research the domain first, write real code examples |
| Cover many topics | Create many thin skills | Create one real skill covering the core use case well |
| Add a placeholder | Create a stub and commit | Add a TODO note to yourself — don't commit incomplete skills |

### Checking Your Work Before Committing

```bash
# Check size (must be ≥ 3000 bytes)
wc -c skills/<domain>/<topic>/SKILL.md

# Check for stub sentinel
grep -l "Implementing this specific pattern or feature" skills/<domain>/<topic>/SKILL.md

# Count code blocks (implementation skills need ≥ 2)
grep -c '```' skills/<domain>/<topic>/SKILL.md
```

See `SKILL_FORMAT_SPEC.md` for the complete content quality specification.

## Creating a New Skill

### Step 1: Create the Directory

Create a new directory under `skills/` with the domain and topic in kebab-case:

```
skills/<domain>/<topic>/
```

Examples:
- `skills/trading/risk-stop-loss/`
- `skills/coding/code-review/`
- `skills/agent/task-decomposition-engine/`
- `skills/cncf/prometheus/`

### Step 2: Create SKILL.md

Inside the new directory, create `SKILL.md` with the required YAML frontmatter and content sections.

---

## Frontmatter Requirements

Every `SKILL.md` must begin with a YAML frontmatter block delimited by `---`.

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Must exactly match the directory name in kebab-case |
| `description` | string | Single line. State what the skill does, not what it is about. Use an active verb. Max ~200 characters. |

**Description Writing Rules:**
- State *what the skill makes the model do*
- Lead with an active verb: `Implements…`, `Selects…`, `Analyzes…`, `Detects…`
- Include 1–2 key domain terms that distinguish this skill from similar ones
- Examples:
  ```yaml
  # ❌ BAD — too vague
  description: Stop loss for trading
  
  # ❌ BAD — describes the topic instead of the skill's action
  description: Information about Prometheus monitoring
  
  # ✅ GOOD — specific action + domain context
  description: Implements stop-loss strategies (fixed percentage, ATR-based, trailing, volatility-adjusted) for position risk management in algorithmic trading systems
  ```

### Recommended Fields

| Field | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `license` | `MIT` | Signals the skill is freely redistributable |
| `compatibility` | `opencode` | Confirms this skill follows OpenCode format conventions |

### The `metadata` Block

The `metadata` block enables auto-loading, categorization, and skill discovery.

| Field | Type | Values / Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `metadata.version` | string | Semantic version: `"1.0.0"` |
| `metadata.domain` | string | One of: `agent`, `cncf`, `coding`, `go`, `linux`, `programming`, `trading`, `writing` |
| `metadata.role` | string | One of: `implementation`, `reference`, `orchestration`, `review` |
| `metadata.scope` | string | One of: `implementation`, `infrastructure`, `orchestration`, `review` |
| `metadata.output-format` | string | One of: `code`, `manifests`, `analysis`, `report` |
| `metadata.triggers` | string | Comma-separated keywords (3–8 terms). **Drives auto-loading.** |
| `metadata.related-skills` | string | Comma-separated skill names (e.g. `trading-risk-kill-switches`) |
| `metadata.author` | string | GitHub URL — **only for externally-sourced skills** |
| `metadata.source` | string | Source repo URL — **only for externally-sourced skills** |

---

## Content Structure

### Minimum Required Sections

Every skill must have these four elements:

1. **H1 Title** — Human-readable name (not the kebab-case identifier)
2. **Role/purpose paragraph** — 1–3 sentences explaining what this skill makes the model do
3. **When to Use** — Bulleted list of situations where this skill applies
4. **Core Workflow or Constraints** — The primary instructions the model must follow

### Recommended Full Structure

Use this template as a starting point:

```markdown

---

## Naming Conventions

### Directory Names

**Must be kebab-case:** lowercase with hyphens between words. Format: `skills/<domain>/<topic>/`

| Valid | Invalid |
|---|---|
| `skills/trading/risk-stop-loss/` | `skills/trading-risk-stop-loss/` |
| `skills/cncf/prometheus/` | `skills/cncf_prometheus/` |
| `skills/coding/code-review/` | `skills/coding_codeReview/` |
| `skills/agent/confidence-based-selector/` | `skills/agentConfidenceSelector/` |

### Frontmatter `name` Field

The `name` field in frontmatter **must match the skill topic** (without domain prefix).

```yaml
# Directory: skills/trading/risk-stop-loss/
---
name: risk-stop-loss  # ✅ Must match topic (domain prefix removed)
# ❌ name: trading-risk-stop-loss  (don't include domain)
# ❌ name: trading_risk_stop_loss  (wrong format)
---
```

### H1 Title

Use a human-readable title, not the kebab-case topic name.

```markdown
# ✅ Stop Loss Manager
# ✅ Confidence-Based Selector (Agent Skill Selection)
# ✅ Prometheus in Cloud-Native Engineering

# ❌ risk-stop-loss
# ❌ confidence-based-selector
```

---

## Triggers Guidelines

### What Triggers Do

The `metadata.triggers` field contains comma-separated keywords that OpenCode matches against the active conversation. When a match is found, the skill is automatically injected into context — no `/skill` command required.

**Auto-loading is the primary way skills get used.** A skill with no triggers relies entirely on users knowing to load it manually.

### Rules for Good Triggers

| Rule | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **3–8 terms** | Fewer than 3 is too narrow. More than 8 dilutes signal and causes false positives. |
| **Include the core topic name** | Always include the primary name: `prometheus`, `stop loss`, `code review` |
| **Include abbreviations** | `ATR`, `PromQL`, `VWAP`, `TDD` — models use these in conversation |
| **Include hyphenated variants** | `stop-loss` alongside `stop loss` |
| **Include common adjacent terms** | What words appear in conversation when someone needs this skill? |
| **Avoid ultra-generic terms** | `risk`, `code`, `data` will trigger on nearly everything |

### Good vs Bad Trigger Examples

#### `trading-risk-stop-loss`

```yaml
# ✅ GOOD
triggers: stop loss, trailing stop, ATR stop, stop placement, position protection, emergency stop, stop-loss

# ❌ TOO BROAD — will fire on nearly any trading conversation
triggers: risk, trading, loss, price

# ❌ TOO NARROW — misses most natural phrasings
triggers: StopLossManager
```

#### `cncf-prometheus`

```yaml
# ✅ GOOD
triggers: prometheus, promql, alerting rules, metrics scraping, kube-state-metrics, servicemonitor, time-series database

# ❌ TOO BROAD — fires whenever anyone mentions monitoring anything
triggers: monitoring, metrics, alerts, kubernetes

# ❌ MISSES ABBREVIATIONS — PromQL is very common in conversation
triggers: prometheus, prometheus operator, alertmanager
```

#### `coding-code-review`

```yaml
# ✅ GOOD
triggers: code review, pull request, PR review, code quality, security audit, OWASP, architectural review

# ❌ TOO BROAD — fires on any coding conversation
triggers: code, review, bugs, security

# ❌ MISSES NATURAL PHRASING — "review this PR" would not match
triggers: code-review, code_review
```

### Trigger Calibration Heuristic

Ask these questions for each trigger candidate:

1. **If someone says this word/phrase, would they plausibly need this skill?** → Include it
2. **Is this word used heavily in other unrelated contexts?** → Exclude or be more specific
3. **Is this a natural abbreviation or shorthand for the topic?** → Include it
4. **Is this only used internally (class name, file name)?** → Exclude it

## Trigger Engineering for Conversational Discovery

Expert trigger design makes skills discoverable through **natural conversation language**, not just technical jargon. This section teaches a two-tier strategy for triggers that match how real users search for help.

### The Two-Tier Trigger Strategy

Effective triggers combine **technical precision** with **conversational accessibility**. Use two complementary tiers:

**Tier 1: Technical Terms** — Exact domain terminology
- Used by practitioners, documentation, official product names
- Examples: `kubernetes`, `EC2`, `PostgreSQL`, `ATR`, `PromQL`

**Tier 2: Conversational Variants** — How non-technical users or the business would phrase their need
- Natural language questions: "how do I...", "what is...", "help with..."
- Business language: "cost savings", "security", "compliance", "performance"
- Everyday terms: "cloud server" (→ EC2), "database" (→ PostgreSQL), "container" (→ Kubernetes)

**Example: Kubernetes Skill**

```
Technical Tier: kubernetes, k8s, container orchestration, pod management, deployment, statefulset
Conversational Tier: managing containers, deploying applications, scaling apps, orchestration, how do i run containers
```

By blending tiers, your skill matches:
- ✅ Expert typing `k8s pod management`
- ✅ Business user typing `how do i scale my apps`
- ✅ Manager typing `container deployment`
- ✅ Learner typing `kubernetes tutorial`

### User-Friendly Trigger Patterns

When designing triggers, use these conversational patterns as templates:

| Pattern | Example Trigger | Use Case | When to Use |
|---------|-----------------|----------|------------|
| **Core Name** | `kubernetes`, `postgresql`, `stop loss` | Primary search term | Always include; this is your main hook |
| **Abbreviation** | `k8s`, `postgres`, `ATR` | Power users, common shorthand | Include if widely known in the domain |
| **"how do I..."** | `how do i run a server`, `how do i store data`, `how do i deploy apps` | Questions non-technical users ask | At least 1 per skill; top priority for discovery |
| **"what is..."** | `what is kubernetes`, `what is load balancing` | Learning/clarification questions | Include if skill explains a concept |
| **"help with..."** | `help with container management`, `help with backups` | Request-style phrasing | Use for operational concerns |
| **Common colloquialisms** | `cloud server` (EC2), `database` (PostgreSQL), `app hosting` | Everyday business language | Match how non-engineers describe the problem |
| **Related tech** | `docker` (→ Kubernetes skill), `yaml` (→ Kubernetes skill), `ssl` (→ security skill) | Adjacent concerns | 1-2 adjacent terms users might search |
| **Operational tasks** | `scaling`, `monitoring`, `backup`, `encryption`, `replication` | Action-oriented phrases | Essential for infrastructure skills |
| **Misspellings/variants** | `postgres` (→ postgresql), `elastic search` (→ opensearch), `k8` (→ k8s) | Common user errors | Include only high-frequency variants |
| **Business value phrases** | `cost savings`, `faster deployment`, `secure storage`, `compliance` | Business/management language | Use when business value is a primary driver |

**Real Example: PostgreSQL Skill**

This skill needs to match queries from:
- DBAs: `postgresql replication`, `postgres backups`, `pg_replication_slots`
- Developers: `sql database`, `how do i store data`, `postgres connection pooling`
- Managers: `managed database`, `database performance`, `reliable data storage`

**Effective Triggers:**
```yaml
triggers: postgresql, postgres, managed database, relational database, how do i store data, backups, replication
```

This hits:
- Technical: `postgresql`, `postgres`, `replication`
- Conversational: `managed database`, `how do i store data`
- Business: `reliable data storage` (implied in "managed database")

### Domain-Specific Trigger Guidelines

Each domain's user base searches differently. Tailor your triggers to their vocabulary:

#### CNCF Skills (Cloud Infrastructure)

**Characteristics:**
- Mixed audience: SREs (technical), DevOps engineers, platform teams
- High operational focus — users search by task, not just product
- Cross-product ecosystem — users often search for multiple solutions

**Trigger Strategy:**

1. **Include both product name AND category name**
   - Good: `kubernetes, container orchestration`
   - Bad: just `kubernetes` (misses "orchestration" searches)

2. **Add operational tasks**
   - Examples: `deploying`, `scaling`, `monitoring`, `logging`, `alerting`, `networking`
   - Why: Users think in tasks first ("how do I scale?"), product second

3. **Add deployment patterns**
   - Examples: `managed`, `self-hosted`, `containerized`, `serverless`
   - Why: Different users search based on deployment model

4. **Add adjacent tech bridge terms**
   - Examples: For Kubernetes: `docker`, `helm`, `istio`; for Prometheus: `grafana`, `alertmanager`
   - Why: Users often know related tools but may not know this one

**Template for CNCF Skills:**
```
primary-product, product-abbreviation, product-category, how-do-i-[task], [deployment-pattern], adjacent-product
```

**Concrete Examples:**

```yaml
# PostgreSQL
triggers: postgresql, postgres, managed database, relational database, how do i store data, backups, replication

# Kubernetes
triggers: kubernetes, k8s, container orchestration, managing containers, deploying applications, scaling apps, helm

# Prometheus
triggers: prometheus, promql, time-series database, metrics monitoring, how do i monitor systems, alerting, grafana
```

#### Trading Skills (Algorithmic & Quantitative)

**Characteristics:**
- Audience: Quants, algo traders, risk managers, portfolio engineers
- Two languages: technical (Python, financial math) + financial (Greeks, risk metrics)
- Regulatory concern — risk compliance vocabulary matters

**Trigger Strategy:**

1. **Include both technical terms AND financial concepts**
   - Technical: `stop loss`, `ATR`, `trailing stop`
   - Financial: `capital protection`, `risk management`, `position control`

2. **Add market context**
   - Examples: `options`, `crypto`, `forex`, `stocks`, `futures`, `equities`
   - Why: Same strategy applies across markets; users search for their market

3. **Add execution concepts**
   - Examples: `entry points`, `exit strategy`, `position sizing`, `portfolio rebalancing`
   - Why: Execution is how traders think about algorithms

4. **Add risk/compliance language**
   - Examples: `risk limits`, `regulatory limits`, `drawdown control`, `loss prevention`
   - Why: Risk managers use this vocabulary

**Template for Trading Skills:**
```
technical-term, financial-concept, how-do-i-[task], market-context, risk-language
```

**Concrete Examples:**

```yaml
# Stop Loss
triggers: stop loss, risk management, capital protection, trading strategy, how do i limit losses, exit points, volatility

# Position Sizing
triggers: position sizing, portfolio allocation, risk management, money management, how much should i trade, kelly criterion

# VWAP Execution
triggers: vwap, volume-weighted average price, execution algorithm, order execution, how do i execute large orders, minimal market impact
```

#### Coding Skills (Implementation & Patterns)

**Characteristics:**
- Audience: Software engineers at all levels (juniors need "how to"; seniors search by pattern)
- Learning angle matters — documentation + tutorials are valuable
- Quality concepts (testing, security, performance) drive searches

**Trigger Strategy:**

1. **Include design patterns AND implementation approach**
   - Pattern: `code review`, `testing`, `refactoring`
   - Approach: `unit testing`, `integration testing`, `peer review`

2. **Add learning variants**
   - Examples: `learn how to`, `tutorial`, `example`, `best practices`, `guide`
   - Why: Junior engineers search this way; valuable for skill discovery

3. **Add use cases**
   - Examples: For testing: `unit test`, `integration test`, `mocking`; for security: `vulnerability`, `injection`, `OWASP`
   - Why: Context matters; same skill applies in different contexts

4. **Add quality/non-functional concerns**
   - Examples: `performance optimization`, `debugging`, `profiling`, `security`, `accessibility`
   - Why: Quality-focused developers search by concern, not pattern name

**Template for Coding Skills:**
```
pattern-name, how-do-i-[implement], use-case, quality-concern, best-practices
```

**Concrete Examples:**

```yaml
# Code Review
triggers: code review, pull request, quality checks, security review, peer review, how do i review code, testing standards

# Refactoring
triggers: refactoring, code quality, technical debt, how do i improve code, legacy code, performance optimization

```

### The 5-8 Term Limit Strategy

You have 5-8 terms total. Prioritize ruthlessly:

**MUST INCLUDE (non-negotiable):**
1. Primary product/concept name (e.g., "Kubernetes", "PostgreSQL", "Code Review")
2. Most common abbreviation if one exists (e.g., "k8s", "postgres", "PR")

**SHOULD INCLUDE (based on domain):**
1. 1-2 conversational variants matching your domain's typical user questions
2. 1 "how do I..." variant if your skill solves a task
3. 1 related operational task or adjacent concern

**COULD INCLUDE (if space allows — 7-8 terms):**
1. Alternative spelling or common misspelling (only high-frequency variants)
2. Business value phrase (only if it's a primary driver)
3. One adjacent technology name (only if users often search for both)

**Worked Example: Stop Loss Skill (Trading)**

Starting candidates (11 terms — too many):
```
stop loss, trailing stop, ATR stop, fixed percentage, volatility stop, 
stop placement, position protection, emergency stop, risk management, 
how do i limit losses, capital protection, stop-loss
```

Prioritize:
```
MUST: stop loss, trailing stop            (core concepts)
SHOULD: ATR stop, position protection,    (domain-specific operational task)
        how do i limit losses              (conversational variant)
COULD: emergency stop, stop-loss          (variant + risk context)
```

Final 7 terms (fits 5-8 limit):
```yaml
triggers: stop loss, trailing stop, ATR stop, stop placement, position protection, how do i limit losses, emergency stop
```

This captures:
- ✅ Technical: `stop loss`, `ATR stop`, `trailing stop`
- ✅ Conversational: `how do i limit losses`, `position protection`
- ✅ Operational: `stop placement`
- ✅ Emergency context: `emergency stop`

### Testing Your Triggers

Before committing a skill, validate your triggers:

**Readability Test:**
- [ ] Read triggers aloud — do they sound like questions you'd hear in Slack or Stack Overflow?
- [ ] Could you imagine each trigger in a real user message?

**Coverage Test:**
- [ ] Ask non-technical teammates — would they use these words?
- [ ] Search for similar skills — do your triggers overlap dangerously?
- [ ] Think of edge cases — what legitimate need might miss your triggers?

**Precision Test:**
- [ ] For each trigger, ask: "If someone searched this, would they always need this skill?"
- [ ] If the answer is "no" for 2+ triggers, revise them

**Diversity Test:**
- [ ] Do your triggers include at least one technical term?
- [ ] Do your triggers include at least one conversational/user phrase?
- [ ] Is there at least one task-oriented term?

### Common Trigger Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|---------|-----|
| **Only technical terms** | Won't match user search language | `kubernetes, k8s, deployment, orchestration` | Add "how do i run containers", "managing containers" |
| **Internal jargon only** | Team-specific vocabulary, not user-facing | `DeploymentController, KubeletConfig` | Use publicly documented terms |
| **Triggers too broad** | Matches irrelevant conversations | `database` (matches every DB) | Be specific: `PostgreSQL`, `managed database` |
| **Triggers too narrow** | Misses natural phrasings | `DatabaseReplicationWithStreamingBinaryLogging` | Simplify to "replication", "backups" |
| **Abbreviations only** | Non-technical users don't know them | `RLS, RBAC, IAM` | Include spelled-out: "role-based access control" |
| **No business language** | Misses business/manager searches | `kubernetes, k8s, containerization, orchestration` | Add "scaling apps", "managing infrastructure" |
| **Missing conversational variants** | Loses discovery opportunities | `code-review, code_review, codereview` | Include `"how do i review code"`, `"pull request"` |
| **Confusing hyphenation** | Different hyphenation = no match | `"stop loss"` but user searches `"stop-loss"` | Include both variants if common |

## Choosing Related Skills

The `metadata.related-skills` field helps users discover complementary skills and prevents skill overlap.

### What Makes a Skill "Related"?

Two skills are related if using one naturally leads to needing the other:

**Strong Relationships (definitely related):**
- Layering: `trading-risk-stop-loss` ↔ `trading-risk-kill-switches` (emergency layer on top)
- Sequencing: `cncf-kubernetes` ↔ `cncf-helm` (install K8s, then manage charts)
- Complementary: `cncf-prometheus` ↔ `cncf-alertmanager` (metrics + alerts)
- Variants: `coding-code-review` ↔ `coding-security-review` (both review practices)

**Weak Relationships (avoid listing):**
- Tangential: `kubernetes` ↔ `docker` (overlapping, but separate skills)
- Too broad: `trading-risk-stop-loss` ↔ `trading-strategy-bollinger-bands` (unrelated strategies)
- Obvious: `kubernetes` ↔ `containers` (container orchestration is about containers)

### How Many Related Skills Should You List?

**Recommend: 2–4 related skills**

- **0–1**: Skill is very standalone (OK, but less discoverable)
- **2–4**: Goldilocks zone — users find complementary skills without overwhelming choice
- **5+**: Too many; dilutes focus and suggests poor boundary design

### Should Relationships Be Reciprocal?

**Yes, always.** If A lists B as related, B should list A.

Example:
```yaml
# trading-risk-stop-loss skill
metadata:
  related-skills: trading-risk-kill-switches, trading-risk-position-sizing

# trading-risk-kill-switches skill must include:
metadata:
  related-skills: trading-risk-stop-loss, ...
```

Without reciprocity, users miss the full skill network.

### Building a Skill Network

When designing a group of related skills, think about the **user journey**:

```
User starts with: "I need risk management"
      ↓
Loads: trading-risk-position-sizing (how much to trade?)
      ↓
Related skills show: trading-risk-stop-loss, trading-risk-kill-switches
      ↓
User loads: trading-risk-stop-loss (where to exit?)
      ↓
Related skills show: trading-risk-position-sizing, trading-risk-kill-switches
```

**Good Network Design:**
- Each skill is a stepping stone to the next
- No isolated skills (always 2+ connections)
- Hierarchical: foundational skills (positioning) → tactical skills (stops) → emergency skills (kill switches)

## Utility Scripts and Automation

This repository includes shell-based automation scripts to maintain skill quality, generate new skills, and validate submissions. These scripts use llama-server with Qwen3 Coder for LLM-powered skill analysis and generation.

### 1. skill-fixer.sh

**Purpose:** Iteratively fixes placeholder/poor code in SKILL.md files using LLM-based analysis.

**Location:** `scripts/skill-fixer.sh`

**What it does:**
- Uses llama-server with Qwen3 Coder to detect placeholder code in SKILL.md files
- Identifies `pass` bodies, `return {}`, generic boilerplate, and stub patterns
- Iteratively fixes issues with configurable retry attempts
- Supports dry-run mode for previewing changes
- Validates YAML frontmatter compliance

**Usage:**
```bash
# Fix all coding/ds-* skills
./scripts/skill-fixer.sh

# Fix all agent skills
./scripts/skill-fixer.sh "skills/agent/*/SKILL.md"

# Preview fixes without modifying files
./scripts/skill-fixer.sh --dry-run

# More retry attempts
./scripts/skill-fixer.sh --max-retries 3

# Audit mode only (check, don't fix)
./scripts/skill-fixer.sh --validate-only
```

**Dependencies:**
- llama-server (local LLM endpoint)
- jq or python3 for JSON parsing
- curl

---

### 2. skill-generate.sh

**Purpose:** Generates new SKILL.md files using the Skill Router + Opencode.

**Location:** `scripts/skill-generate.sh`

**What it does:**
- Generates SKILL.md files by delegating to opencode with SKILL_FORMAT_SPEC.md as context
- No API calls needed — opencode handles everything in one pass
- Auto-extracts skill name from description if omitted
- Supports committing/pushing to git automatically
- Lists available domains and their skill counts

**Usage:**
```bash
# Generate a skill about Kubernetes networking
./scripts/skill-generate.sh "Generate a skill about Kubernetes networking"

# Generate with specific domain and name
./scripts/skill-generate.sh "Add a Go concurrency pattern for rate limiting" \
    -d go -n rate-limiting

# Generate locally only (no push)
./scripts/skill-generate.sh "Create a trading skill about VWAP strategies" \
    --no-push

# List all domains and skill counts
./scripts/skill-generate.sh --domain-list
```

---

### 3. validate_skill.sh

**Purpose:** Validates a SKILL.md file against stub detection rules.

**Location:** `scripts/validate_skill.sh`

**What it does:**
- Performs static checks against stub detection rules (size, sentinels, triggers)
- Optional LLM-powered quality check with `--llm` flag
- Exit codes: 0 = PASS, 1 = FAIL
- Checks frontmatter compliance, content depth, and trigger quality

**Usage:**
```bash
# Static checks only
./scripts/validate_skill.sh skills/coding/my-skill/SKILL.md

# Static + LLM quality check
./scripts/validate_skill.sh --llm skills/coding/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

---

### 4. fix-agent-skills.sh

**Purpose:** Fixes generic boilerplate in agent skills using domain-specific prompts.

**Location:** `scripts/fix-agent-skills.sh`

**What it does:**
- Wraps `skill-fixer.sh` with a domain-specific prompt for agent skills
- Optimized for removing generic orchestration boilerplate
- Replaces placeholder content with domain-specific examples

**Usage:**
```bash
# Fix all agent skills
./scripts/fix-agent-skills.sh

# Preview fixes only
./scripts/fix-agent-skills.sh --dry-run
```

---

### 5. fix-coding-ds-skills.sh

**Purpose:** Fixes placeholder code in data science coding skills.

**Location:** `scripts/fix-coding-ds-skills.sh`

**What it does:**
- Wraps `skill-fixer.sh` with a domain-specific prompt for data science skills
- Optimized for data science code examples
- Targets `coding/ds-*` SKILL.md files

**Usage:**
```bash
# Fix all ds-* skills
./scripts/fix-coding-ds-skills.sh

# More retry attempts
./scripts/fix-coding-ds-skills.sh --max-retries 3
```

---

### 6. Other Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docker-smoke-test.sh` | Builds and runs Docker container for smoke testing the skill-router |
| `start-skill-router.sh` | Starts skill-router container (used by systemd user service) |
| `install_hooks.sh` | Installs git hooks for the repository (pre-commit validation) |
| `run-all-ds-fix.sh` | One-liner to run all ds-* skills through the fixer |

---

## Recommended Workflow

When adding or modifying skills, follow this step-by-step process:

### 1. Create or Edit Skill

Create a new skill directory and SKILL.md file:
```bash
mkdir -p skills/<domain>/<topic>/
# Edit skills/<domain>/<topic>/SKILL.md
# Follow skill schema from this document
```

Ensure your SKILL.md includes:
- ✅ Proper YAML frontmatter with all required fields
- ✅ H1 title (human-readable)
- ✅ When to Use section
- ✅ When NOT to Use section
- ✅ Core content (Purpose, Patterns, etc.)
- ✅ 5-8 specific triggers (both technical and conversational)

### 2. Validate Skill

Run the validator to check your skill meets quality standards:
```bash
./scripts/validate_skill.sh skills/<domain>/<topic>/SKILL.md
```

For an LLM-powered quality check:
```bash
./scripts/validate_skill.sh --llm skills/<domain>/<topic>/SKILL.md
```

**Check output:** Verify exit code 0 (PASS) before proceeding.

### 3. Generate / Fix Skills (Optional)

For new skills, use the generator:
```bash
./scripts/skill-generate.sh "Generate a skill about X"
```

For fixing existing skills with placeholder code:
```bash
# Fix all agent skills
./scripts/fix-agent-skills.sh

# Fix all coding/ds-* skills
./scripts/fix-coding-ds-skills.sh

# Dry-run mode to preview changes
./scripts/skill-fixer.sh "skills/<domain>/*/SKILL.md" --dry-run
```

### 4. Update README Catalog

Regenerate the README with your new/modified skill:
```bash
python3 scripts/generate_readme.py
```

**Verify:** Check that your skill appears in the README with correct name, description, and hyperlink.

### 5. Commit and Push

Commit all changes:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add [skill-name] skill

- New skill directory: skills/[domain]/[topic]/
- Description: [your description]
- Triggers: [list key triggers]
- Updated skill catalog and router index"
git push origin main
```

### 6. Verify Auto-Discovery

- The skill-router automatically fetches updated `skills-index.json` every `SKILL_SYNC_INTERVAL` seconds (default: 1 hour)
- For immediate pickup: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/reload`

---

## Automation One-Liner

To run all scripts in sequence (recommended for new skills):

```bash
./scripts/validate_skill.sh skills/<domain>/<topic>/SKILL.md && \
python3 scripts/generate_readme.py && \
echo "✅ All automation complete!"
```

This ensures:
1. ✅ Skill is valid (stub-free, proper frontmatter)
2. ✅ README catalog is refreshed

---

## CI/CD Integration

For automated skill maintenance, run these commands in your CI/CD pipeline:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Validate all skills
./scripts/validate_skill.sh skills/*/SKILL.md || exit 1

# Regenerate documentation
python3 scripts/generate_readme.py || exit 1

# Verify all skills are valid
git diff --exit-code || {
  echo "⚠ Skills need updates. Please run automation scripts."
  exit 1
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### SKILL.md not found
**Problem:** Script skips a skill because SKILL.md is missing.  
**Solution:** Ensure your skill directory contains a SKILL.md file in the root.

### YAML parsing error
**Problem:** `validate_skill.sh --llm` reports invalid YAML.  
**Solution:** 
- Check for missing quotes around strings with colons
- Ensure proper indentation (2 spaces, no tabs)
- Validate YAML at https://www.yamllint.com/

### Validation failing
**Problem:** `validate_skill.sh` returns exit code 1.  
**Solution:** Check the output for specific stub detection violations (size, sentinels, trigger quality) and fix accordingly.

### README not updating
**Problem:** Your skill doesn't appear in the generated README.  
**Solution:** 
- Check that SKILL.md has valid YAML frontmatter
- Ensure `name` field is present and matches directory name
- Ensure `description` field is present

### Skill not auto-loading
**Problem:** Skill triggers not matching conversation.  
**Solution:** 
- Ensure `skills-index.json` is up to date
- Check trigger keywords match natural conversation language
- Reload skill-router: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/reload`

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Directory name uses underscores | Skill may not be found | Use kebab-case: `trading-risk-stop-loss`, not `trading_risk_stop_loss` |
| `name` in frontmatter doesn't match directory | Validation fails | Make them exactly match (case-sensitive) |
| Missing `triggers` field | Skill never auto-loads | Add 3–8 specific keywords |
| Generic triggers (`code`, `data`, `risk`) | Fires on nearly everything | Use domain-specific phrases |
| Missing `metadata.triggers` field | Skill never auto-loads | Add 3–8 specific keywords |
| H1 title equals kebab-case name | Unreadable | Use human-readable title |
| Missing "When NOT to Use" section | Model applies skill inappropriately | Always include exclusion cases for complex skills |
| Code without typing | Ambiguous signatures | Add Python type hints and docstrings |
| Links to placeholder URLs | Broken references | Use real URLs or omit the link |
| Generic workflow steps | Creates a stub — router returns useless content | Write actual numbered steps with specific commands/code |
| Skill under 3,000 bytes | Guaranteed stub — model gets nothing actionable | Expand with real examples before committing |
| Missing TL;DR for Code Generation | Model wastes tokens reading prose before coding | Add the section with 3–7 specific constraints |

# Stop Loss Manager

Implements stop loss mechanisms to limit losses and protect capital.

## When to Use

- Implementing position risk controls for any long or short position
- Designing or reviewing a stop loss strategy for a new trading algorithm
- Choosing between stop types for a specific market condition

## Core Workflow

1. **Assess Market Regime** — Determine if market is trending, ranging, or high-volatility.
2. **Select Stop Type** — Choose the appropriate stop strategy for the regime.
3. **Calculate Stop Level** — Apply the selected formula.

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: ATR-Based Stop

```python
def atr_stop(current_price: float, atr: float, multiplier: float = 2.0) -> float:
    """Calculate ATR-based stop loss level."""
    return current_price - (atr * multiplier)
```

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- Layer an emergency stop on top of every other stop type
- Base trailing stop distance on ATR, not a fixed price

### MUST NOT DO
- Use stop type as the only risk control layer
- Disable or bypass stops "temporarily"
```
