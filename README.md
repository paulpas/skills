# OpenCode Skills

A curated collection of skills for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) AI sessions, organized by domain. Each skill is a self-contained `SKILL.md` file that injects specialized behavior, knowledge, and constraints into the AI's context — turning a general-purpose assistant into a focused expert for the task at hand. This repository is intended for engineers who want consistent, high-quality AI assistance across cloud-native infrastructure, algorithmic trading, software engineering patterns, agent orchestration, and algorithm reference.

---

## How It Works

A **skill** is a Markdown document stored at `<domain>-<topic>/SKILL.md`. When loaded, its full content becomes part of the active model context, shaping how the AI responds to the current task. Skills carry structured YAML frontmatter that identifies their domain, role, and trigger keywords.

OpenCode loads skills in two ways:

| Loading Mode | Mechanism | When It Fires |
|---|---|---|
| **Manual** | User types `/skill <name>` in the OpenCode chat | Explicitly requested |
| **Auto-load** | `metadata.triggers` keyword match | Detected in conversation context |

Auto-loading is the primary mechanism: when your message contains a keyword listed in a skill's `triggers` field, that skill is automatically injected into context — no command required. Manual loading is available for any skill at any time via `/skill <name>`.

---

## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)

Clone the repository to your OpenCode global skills directory. All skills become available in every OpenCode session.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulpas/skills.git ~/.config/opencode/skills
```

### Project-Local Installation

Clone to a project's `.opencode/skills` directory to scope skills to that project only.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulpas/skills.git .opencode/skills
```

### Selective Installation (Symlinks)

To use only specific skills, symlink individual skill directories into either install location:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/skills/cncf-prometheus ~/.config/opencode/skills/cncf-prometheus
ln -s /path/to/skills/trading-risk-stop-loss ~/.config/opencode/skills/trading-risk-stop-loss
```

### Verification

After installation, skills are discovered automatically. Verify by:

1. Starting a new OpenCode session in your project directory
2. Mentioning a topic covered by a skill (e.g., "help me with prometheus metrics") — the matching skill auto-loads
3. Or load manually: type `/skill <skill-name>` in the OpenCode chat (e.g., `/skill cncf-prometheus`)

---

## Directory Structure

Skills follow a strict `<domain>-<topic>/SKILL.md` layout. The directory name is intentionally descriptive — you can identify a skill's purpose without consulting this file.

```
skills/
  agent-confidence-based-selector/
    SKILL.md
