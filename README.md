# Skills

A growing collection of OpenCode skills organized by domain. Each skill is a self-contained directory (`<prefix>-<topic>/SKILL.md`) — the directory name is intentionally descriptive so you can find what you need without consulting this file. New domains and skills are added over time.

## Quick Setup

To use these skills in OpenCode, install them to your OpenCode configuration directory.

### Global Installation (Recommended)

Copy or link skills to your global OpenCode config directory:

```bash
# Clone to global skills directory
git clone https://github.com/your-org/skills.git ~/.config/opencode/skills
```

### Project-Local Installation

For project-specific skills, install to `.opencode/skills`:

```bash
# Clone to project-local skills directory
git clone https://github.com/your-org/skills.git .opencode/skills
```

### Verification

After installation, verify skills are loading:

```bash
# List all available skills
ocx skill list

# Load a specific skill
ocx skill cncf-kubernetes

# Check which skills are currently loaded
ocx skill show
```

Skills are automatically discovered when you run `/skill` command in OpenCode.
