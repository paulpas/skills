# Agent Skill Router — 1,827 Expert Skills with Built-In Compression

**An AI skill routing system that automatically selects and injects the right expertise into your AI's context.** With 1,827 skills across 5 domains and built-in SkillCompressor for reducing token overhead, the router makes expert knowledge instantly available without manual commands.

```
You → "review this Python code for security issues"
      ↓
skill-router auto-fires → embeds task → vector search → LLM ranks → loads skills
      ↓
Full expert skills injected into context (compressed if needed) — AI answers as expert reviewer
```

**Key Features:**
- 🎯 **1,827 Skills** organized across Agent, CNCF, Coding, Programming, and Trading domains
- 🔄 **Auto-Routing** — tasks automatically match the most relevant skills
- 🗜️ **SkillCompressor** — reduce token overhead by 28-65% with configurable compression levels (0-10+)
- ⚡ **Fast** — cached warm requests respond in ~10ms; cold requests in ~3.5s
- 📦 **Self-Contained** — run locally or via Docker; no external API required for routing
- 🔌 **MCP Integration** — works with OpenCode's `route_to_skill` tool

---

## Quick Start

### Installation (OpenAI)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulpas/agent-skill-router
cd agent-skill-router
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... ./install-skill-router.sh --integrate-opencode
```

Restart OpenCode. Every task automatically routes to the most relevant skill.

### Local Model (no API key required)

```bash
./install-skill-router.sh \
  --provider llamacpp \
  --embedding-provider llamacpp \
  --llamacpp-url http://localhost:8080
```

> **Note:** llama.cpp must serve both `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/embeddings`.

## Compression Configuration

### What Is Compression?

SkillCompressor reduces the token overhead of skill content by removing unnecessary whitespace, comments, and formatting. This saves 28-65% of tokens while preserving all executable code and critical information.

| Level | Description | Token Savings | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **0** | No compression | 0% | Development, testing, debugging |
| **1** | Remove blank lines + trailing whitespace | ~12% | Default for streaming |
| **2** | Level 1 + collapse multiple spaces | ~18% | Balanced (recommended for most) |
| **3** | Level 2 + remove comments | ~24% | Production with code focus |
| **4** | Level 3 + minify JSON/YAML | ~28% | **Default in Docker** — sweet spot |
| **5** | Level 4 + strip metadata | ~35% | Aggressive compression |
| **6-8** | Progressive minification | 40-50% | Content-heavy skills only |
| **9-10+** | Maximum compression | 50-65% | Only for huge reference skills |

### Building with Compression

Build Docker images with a specific compression level:

```bash
# Build with level 4 (28% savings, recommended)
docker build --build-arg COMPRESSION_LEVEL=4 -t skill-router:latest .

# Build with level 2 (18% savings, more readable)
docker build --build-arg COMPRESSION_LEVEL=2 -t skill-router:latest .

# Build with maximum compression (65% savings)
docker build --build-arg COMPRESSION_LEVEL=10 -t skill-router:latest .
```

### Running with Compression

Set compression at runtime:

```bash
# Default (no compression)
node dist/index.js

# Level 2 (18% savings, recommended)
SKILL_COMPRESSION_LEVEL=2 node dist/index.js

# Level 4 (28% savings, Docker default)
SKILL_COMPRESSION_LEVEL=4 node dist/index.js

# Level 5 (35% savings, aggressive)
SKILL_COMPRESSION_LEVEL=5 node dist/index.js
```

### API Queries with Compression

Request compressed skill content via HTTP:

```bash
# Get uncompressed skill
curl http://localhost:3000/skill/coding-code-review

# Get skill with level 2 compression (18% savings)
curl "http://localhost:3000/skill/coding-code-review?compression=2"

# Get skill with level 4 compression (28% savings)
curl "http://localhost:3000/skill/coding-code-review?compression=4"

# Get skill with maximum compression (65% savings)
curl "http://localhost:3000/skill/coding-code-review?compression=10"
```

### Docker Compose Example

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  skill-router:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        COMPRESSION_LEVEL: 4    # 28% token savings
    environment:
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      SKILL_COMPRESSION_LEVEL: 4
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./skills:/app/skills     # local skills mount
```

Run with:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Compression Metrics

Monitor compression savings:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/metrics
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "compression": {
    "level": 4,
    "avgTokenSavings": "28%",
    "skillsCompressed": 1777,
    "totalBytesOriginal": 52000000,
    "totalBytesCompressed": 37440000,
    "averageCompressionRatio": 0.72
  }
}
```

## How It Works

Every task triggers the `route_to_skill` MCP tool, which:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as OpenCode User
    participant MCP as skill-router MCP
    participant API as Fastify :3000
    participant Embed as Embedding Service
    participant VDB as Vector Database
    participant LLM as LLM Ranker
    participant GH as GitHub Raw (or disk)

    U->>MCP: invoke route_to_skill(task)
    MCP->>API: POST /route {"task":"..."}
    API->>Embed: generate task embedding
    Embed-->>API: task vector
    API->>VDB: cosine similarity → top-20
    VDB-->>API: candidates with scores
    API->>LLM: rank candidates
    LLM-->>API: ranked skills with scores
    API-->>MCP: selected skills
    par fetch all skills
        MCP->>API: GET /skill/name-1
        MCP->>API: GET /skill/name-2
    end
    API->>GH: fetch SKILL.md (cached)
    GH-->>API: raw SKILL.md (optionally compressed)
    API-->>MCP: skill content(s)
    MCP-->>U: skills injected into context
    Note over U: Response ends with: > 📖 skill: name-1, name-2
```

### Latency

| Stage | Cold | Warm (cached) |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Task embedding | ~400 ms | ~1 ms |
| Vector search | ~1 ms | ~1 ms |
| LLM ranking | ~3,000 ms | ~5 ms |
| Skill fetch + compression | ~150 ms | ~1 ms |
| **Total** | **~3.5 s** | **~10 ms** |

## Workflow: Adding New Skills

Create skills following this workflow:

### 1. Create Directory and SKILL.md

```bash
mkdir -p skills/<domain>/<skill-name>/
touch skills/<domain>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

### 2. Write SKILL.md with Proper Format

```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name
description: What this skill does in one sentence
license: MIT
compatibility: opencode
metadata:
  version: "1.0.0"
  domain: coding
  role: implementation
  scope: implementation
  output-format: code
  triggers: keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, how do i implement
---

# My Skill Title

Brief description of the skill's purpose and when to use it.

## When to Use

- Concrete use case 1
- Concrete use case 2

## When NOT to Use

- Anti-pattern or irrelevant context

## Core Workflow

1. **Step 1** — Description
2. **Step 2** — Description
3. **Step 3** — Description

## Implementation Patterns

```python
# Example code
```

## Related Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [related-skill](../../skills/domain/related-skill/SKILL.md) | Why you'd use this alongside |
```

### 3. Validate and Regenerate Index

```bash
# Validate YAML syntax
python3 scripts/reformat_skills.py

# Update router index
python3 generate_index.py

# Regenerate README catalog
python3 scripts/generate_readme.py
```

### 4. Commit and Push

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add my-skill-name skill

- New skill directory: skills/<domain>/<skill-name>/
- Description: Brief description
