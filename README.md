# Skills — An AI Skill Routing System

265 expert skills for AI coding agents, with a built-in routing engine that automatically selects and injects the right skill into your AI's context before it answers. No manual `/skill` commands — just ask, and the right expertise loads itself.

```
You → "review this Python code for security issues"
         ↓
   route_to_skill()  [auto-fires on every task]
         ↓
   embed → vector search → LLM re-rank → coding-security-review/SKILL.md
         ↓
   Full expert skill injected into context — AI answers as a security reviewer
```

## Quick Start

**With OpenAI (recommended):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulpas/skills
cd skills
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... ./install-skill-router.sh --integrate-opencode
```

Restart OpenCode. Every task you type now automatically routes to the most relevant skill.

**No API key? Use a local model:**

```bash
./install-skill-router.sh \
  --provider llamacpp \
  --embedding-provider llamacpp \
  --llamacpp-url http://localhost:8080
```

> llama.cpp must serve both `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/embeddings`. No `OPENAI_API_KEY` required.

## How It Works

Every time OpenCode receives a task, the `route_to_skill` MCP tool fires automatically:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as OpenCode (User)
    participant MCP as skill-router-mcp.js
    participant API as Fastify :3000
    participant Safety as Safety Layer
    participant Embed as Embedding Service
    participant VDB as Vector Database
    participant LLM as LLM Ranker
    participant GH as GitHub Raw

    Note over MCP: On startup: sync skill-router-api.md from GitHub
    U->>MCP: invoke route_to_skill(task)
    MCP->>API: POST /route {"task":"..."}
    API->>Safety: validate request (2+ signals to block)
    Safety-->>API: pass
    API->>Embed: generate task embedding (~400ms, cached after first)
    Embed-->>API: task vector
    API->>VDB: cosine similarity search → top-20 candidates
    VDB-->>API: candidates with similarity scores
    API->>LLM: rank candidates (cache check first)
    Note over LLM: Cache hit: ~5ms · Cold: ~3,000ms
    LLM-->>API: ranked skills with scores + reasoning
    API-->>MCP: all selected skills (name + score)
    par fetch all skills in parallel
        MCP->>API: GET /skill/name-1
        MCP->>API: GET /skill/name-2
    end
    API->>GH: fetch SKILL.md content on demand (cached in memory)
    GH-->>API: raw SKILL.md
    API-->>MCP: skill content(s)
    MCP-->>U: all skill contents injected into context
    Note over U: Response ends with: > 📖 skill: name-1, name-2
```

### Latency

| Stage | Cold | Warm (cached) |
|---|---|---|
| Safety check | ~1 ms | ~1 ms |
| Task embedding | ~400 ms | ~1 ms (memory) |
| Vector search | ~1 ms | ~1 ms |
| LLM re-ranking | ~3,000 ms | ~5 ms (cache hit) |
| Skill content fetch | ~1 ms (disk) / ~150 ms (GitHub) | ~1 ms (memory) |
| **Total** | **~3.5 s** | **~10 ms** |

> Local llama.cpp drops cold LLM step to ~200–800 ms. Warm requests are fast regardless of provider.

### Key Behaviours

- **Multi-skill loading** — all high-confidence matches are fetched in parallel; the AI receives full context for each
- **Skill citation** — every response ends with `> 📖 skill: name-1, name-2` listing loaded skills
- **Auto index refresh** — `skills-index.json` is re-fetched from GitHub every `SKILL_SYNC_INTERVAL` seconds (default: 1 hour); new skills become routable without restart
- **API doc sync** — `skill-router-api.md` is fetched from GitHub on every MCP startup; edits to the repo file propagate automatically
- **LLM ranking cache** — identical task+candidates combos are served from memory (~5 ms) on repeat queries
- **Batch embeddings** — all skill embeddings are generated in parallel batches of 100 on startup (~2 s total)

---

## Monitoring

| What | Command |
|---|---|
| Skill accesses (MCP side) | `tail -f ~/.config/opencode/skill-router-mcp.log \| grep 'SKILL ACCESS'` |
| Full routing pipeline (Docker) | `docker logs -f skill-router 2>&1 \| grep -E 'Route result\|Vector search'` |
| Routing history (JSON) | `curl -s http://localhost:3000/access-log \| python3 -m json.tool` |
| Service health | `curl -s http://localhost:3000/health` |

## Utility Scripts

This repository includes automation scripts to maintain the skill catalog and improve trigger quality:

### 1. generate_readme.py

**Purpose:** Auto-generates the skills catalog in the README with zero manual effort.

**Location:** `scripts/generate_readme.py`

**What it does:**
- Reads all skill directories and extracts metadata (name, description, domain, role, triggers)
- Organizes skills into three auto-generated sections:
  - **Skills by Domain** — Grouped by domain category (agent, cncf, coding, trading, programming)
  - **Skills by Role** — Grouped by skill role (implementation, reference, orchestration, review)
  - **Complete Skills Index** — Alphabetical table of all 239+ skills with descriptions and triggers
- Inserts content between `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED SKILLS INDEX START/END -->` markers
- Preserves all existing README content outside the markers
- Includes generation timestamp
- Creates clickable hyperlinks to all skill SKILL.md files

**Usage:**
```bash
# Update README.md in-place
python3 scripts/generate_readme.py

# Generate custom output file
python3 scripts/generate_readme.py --output custom_skills.md
```

**When to use:**
- After adding new skills to the repository
- After modifying skill metadata (description, triggers, domain, role)
- Before committing changes to ensure README is up-to-date
- As part of CI/CD pipeline for automatic catalog maintenance

**Example output:**
All 239+ skills appear in the README with:
- Clickable links to `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Description from skill frontmatter
- Trigger keywords for skill discovery
- Organization by domain and role

---

### 2. enhance_triggers.py

**Purpose:** Adds user-friendly, conversational triggers to skills for improved discoverability.

**Location:** `scripts/enhance_triggers.py`

**What it does:**
- Scans all 239+ skills in the repository
- Identifies skills that could benefit from additional conversational triggers
- Adds user-friendly variants like:
  - "how do I..." questions
  - "what is..." clarifications
  - Common colloquialisms and business language
  - Related technology names
  - Operational task language
- Maintains the 5-8 term trigger limit per skill
- Generates detailed report in `TRIGGER_ENHANCEMENTS.md`
- Preserves YAML formatting and existing content

**Usage:**
```bash
# Enhance all skills and generate report
python3 scripts/enhance_triggers.py
```

**When to use:**
- After reviewing existing skill triggers for quality
- When skills need better user discovery
- After adding new skill categories
- To ensure triggers match both technical AND conversational language

**Example enhancements:**
```yaml
# Before
triggers: kubernetes, k8s, container orchestration, pod management

# After (with user-friendly variants added)
triggers: kubernetes, k8s, container orchestration, managing containers, how do i deploy apps
```

**Output:**
- Updates all SKILL.md files with improved triggers
- Generates `TRIGGER_ENHANCEMENTS.md` report showing:
  - All enhanced skills
  - Before/after trigger comparison
  - Enhancement statistics by domain
  - Quality assurance metrics

---

### 3. reformat_skills.py

**Purpose:** Validates and normalizes YAML frontmatter across all skills.

**Location:** `scripts/reformat_skills.py`

**What it does:**
- Validates YAML syntax in all skill frontmatter
- Normalizes formatting (indentation, field order)
- Fills in missing optional metadata fields from templates
- Reports errors and validation failures

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 scripts/reformat_skills.py
```

---

### 4. generate_index.py

**Purpose:** Regenerates the skill-router index for skill discovery.

**Location:** `generate_index.py` (top-level, maintained by repository)

**What it does:**
- Reads all skill metadata
- Generates `skills-index.json` for skill-router consumption
- Enables auto-loading of skills based on triggers
- Updates skill statistics and categorization

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 generate_index.py
```

---

## Recommended Workflow

When adding or modifying skills:

1. **Create or edit skill SKILL.md file**
   - Place in `skills/<skill-name>/` directory
   - Follow skill schema from [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)

2. **Run reformat_skills.py**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/reformat_skills.py
   ```

3. **Run enhance_triggers.py** (optional, for trigger improvement)
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/enhance_triggers.py
   ```

4. **Run generate_index.py**
   ```bash
   python3 generate_index.py
   ```

5. **Run generate_readme.py** (to update catalog)
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/generate_readme.py
   ```

6. **Commit and push**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat: add [skill-name] skill"
   git push origin main
   ```

**Or use one-line automation:**
```bash
python3 scripts/reformat_skills.py && \
python3 generate_index.py && \
python3 scripts/generate_readme.py
```

## Adding Skills

Create `skills/<domain>-<topic>/SKILL.md` following the format in [SKILL_FORMAT_SPEC.md](./SKILL_FORMAT_SPEC.md). Run `python reformat_skills.py` to apply standard frontmatter. Run `python3 generate_index.py` after adding a skill to update `skills-index.json`, then push. The router auto-discovers new skills within `SKILL_SYNC_INTERVAL` seconds (default: 1 hour). For immediate pickup: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/reload`

```yaml

  domain: coding
  role: implementation
  scope: implementation
  output-format: code
  triggers: keyword1, keyword2, keyword3

```

Good triggers are specific and task-oriented (`kubernetes, k8s, pod, deployment, kubectl`) rather than generic (`cloud, infrastructure, ops`).
