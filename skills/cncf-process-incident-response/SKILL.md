# CNCF Incident Response Process

Creates or updates an incident response plan with the step-by-step process for triaging, remediating, and disclosing a confirmed security vulnerability.

## When to Use

Use when:
- A project has never formally documented how it responds to a confirmed vulnerability
- The project is expanding its security team and needs a shared runbook
- A post-incident review revealed gaps in the response process

Do NOT use when:
- The project does not yet have a `SECURITY.md` — the reporting channel must exist before defining the response process; run the security-policy skill first

## Steps

1. **Fetch the template.**
   If GitHub MCP available: `github_get_contents` path=`cncf/tag-security/main/project-resources/templates/INCIDENT-RESPONSE.md`
   Otherwise: `gh api repos/cncf/tag-security/contents/project-resources/templates/INCIDENT-RESPONSE.md`

2. **Fill in Triage:** who is notified first, severity rating (CVSS or project-defined),
   decision criteria for patch vs. mitigate.

3. **Fill in Remediation:** branching strategy, who has access to private security forks,
   how patches are tested without public disclosure.
   ⚠️ Access to private forks must be defined now — unclear access during an active incident delays patching.

4. **Fill in Coordinated Disclosure:** how downstream distributors are notified before
   public disclosure, embargo period, and GitHub Security Advisory publishing process.
   ⚠️ Verify the timeline matches the response timeline in SECURITY.md — inconsistencies are a graduation finding.

5. **Fill in Communication:** what the public announcement includes, which channels
   are used (GitHub Security Advisory, project mailing list), who approves.
   ⚠️ One named person must own each active incident; "the security contacts will handle it" is not a runbook.

6. **Fill in Post-Incident Review:** blameless retrospective process and how learnings
   feed back into the security policy.

7. **Cross-link to the security self-assessment** under Remediation or Post-Incident Review.

## Checklist

- [ ] Triage process documented with severity definitions
- [ ] Private patch development access defined by name/role (graduation)
- [ ] Coordinated disclosure timeline defined and consistent with SECURITY.md (graduation)
- [ ] Named incident commander role defined (graduation)
- [ ] Public communication plan documented
- [ ] Post-incident review process defined
- [ ] Cross-link to security self-assessment present (graduation)
- [ ] GitHub Security Advisory draft workflow verified accessible to all contacts (graduation)
