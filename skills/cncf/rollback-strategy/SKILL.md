# Rollback Strategy

Designs and implements safe, data-aware rollback procedures for deployment recovery. Handles partial rollbacks, data consistency during rollback, and automated rollback triggers based on health signals.

## TL;DR Checklist

- [ ] Define rollback triggers for each deployment health signal
- [ ] Ensure rollback is tested at least once per quarter
- [ ] Plan data rollback before deployment — can you reverse the migration?
- [ ] Implement partial rollback for multi-service deployments
- [ ] Document rollback RTO (recovery time objective) and test against it

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- **Designing rollback procedures for a new deployment strategy** — You need to know what happens when things go wrong
- **Implementing automated rollback triggers** — Health signals should trigger rollback without human intervention
- **Planning a high-risk deployment** — Database migration, data format change, or API contract change
- **Investigating a failed deployment** — You need to understand rollback options for the current situation
- **Auditing existing rollback capabilities** — You're reviewing whether your rollback procedures are adequate

---

## When NOT to Use

Avoid this skill for:

- **Simple deployments with instant rollback available** — If blue-green gives you instant rollback, detailed strategy is less critical
- **Stateless deployments with no data changes** — Replacing all instances with a previous version is sufficient
- **When the deployment has no known failure mode** — If nothing can go wrong, you don't need a rollback strategy

---

## Core Workflow

### 1. Identify Rollback Scope

Determine what needs to be rolled back: application code, database schema, cached data, configuration, or a combination.

**Checkpoint:** You know the full scope of what must revert to the previous state.

### 2. Define Rollback Triggers

For each health signal, define the threshold that triggers automatic rollback. Prioritize signals that indicate real user impact over cosmetic issues.

**Checkpoint:** Every deployment has at least one automated rollback trigger and one manual rollback gate.

### 3. Design Data Rollback Path

For any data change during deployment, define how to reverse it. Data rollback is harder than code rollback because it may involve partial writes, partial migrations, or corrupted data.

**Checkpoint:** You have a tested procedure for reversing every data change that the deployment introduces.

### 4. Implement Partial Rollback

For multi-service deployments, define what happens when only one service needs rollback. Other services must handle the version downgrade gracefully.

**Checkpoint:** Each service can handle being one version behind its dependencies.

### 5. Execute and Validate

When rollback is triggered, execute it and validate that the system is back to a known good state. Monitor for 5+ minutes post-rollback.

**Checkpoint:** All health signals return to baseline levels after rollback.

---

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Automated Rollback Trigger System

Implement automated rollback based on health signal thresholds.

#### ❌ BAD — Manual Rollback Decision

```bash
# ❌ BAD: Waiting for human to notice and decide to rollback
# No automated health checks, no rollback triggers, no error monitoring
kubectl set image deployment/app app=app:v2.0.0
kubectl rollout status deployment/app
# If this breaks, someone has to:
# 1. Notice the error (users complain, or on-call gets paged)
# 2. Decide it's the deployment (could be anything)
# 3. Decide to rollback (not just restart, which loses state)
# 4. Execute the rollback (which takes minutes to hours)
# By then, hundreds of users are affected.
```

**What's wrong:**
- No automated detection of deployment failure
- No automated rollback — human decision latency adds minutes of user impact
- No signal correlation — can't distinguish deployment failure from unrelated outage
- No rollback validation — nobody confirms the rollback actually worked

#### ✅ GOOD — Automated Rollback with Signal Correlation

```bash
# ✅ GOOD: Automated rollback with health signal evaluation and cooldown
# Triggers evaluated continuously — any breach causes immediate rollback

# --- Configuration ---
APP_NAME="my-app"
PROMETHEUS_URL="http://prometheus:9090"
ROLLBACK_STATE="/tmp/rollback-state.json"
STATE_DIR="/tmp/rollback-tracker"

# Define rollback triggers (JSON)
# Each trigger has a metric, threshold, and action
TRIGGERS_FILE="/tmp/rollback-triggers.json"
# [
#   {"name": "error_rate", "metric": "http_errors_per_second", "threshold_fn": "v > 10", "cooldown": 60},
#   {"name": "latency", "metric": "request_latency_p99_ms", "threshold_fn": "v > 2000", "cooldown": 60},

### Pattern 2: Data-Aware Rollback

Handle data changes during rollback — reversing migrations, cleaning up partial writes, and maintaining data consistency.

#### ✅ GOOD — Data-Aware Rollback Procedures

```bash
# ✅ GOOD: Data-aware rollback with idempotent steps and approval gates
# Handles schema changes, data migrations, and cache invalidation safely

# --- Configuration ---
DB_HOST="db-primary"
DB_NAME="app_db"
DB_USER="app_user"
DRY_RUN=false
APPROVED=false

# --- Data rollback step definitions (JSON) ---
# Each step defines the SQL, idempotency, and approval requirements
ROLLBACK_STEPS_FILE="/tmp/data-rollback-steps.json"
# [
#   {"name": "drop_backfilled_columns", "sql": "ALTER TABLE orders DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS shipping_street", "idempotent": true, "requires_approval": false},
#   {"name": "revert_data_format", "sql": "UPDATE orders SET address = old_address WHERE address IS NOT NULL", "idempotent": false, "requires_approval": true}
# ]

# --- Execute rollback steps in reverse order ---
execute_data_rollback() {
  local steps_file=$1
  local dry_run=$2
  local approved=$3

  echo "=== Data Rollback Execution ==="
  local total
  total=$(jq 'length' "$steps_file")
  echo "Total steps: $total"
  echo "Dry run: $dry_run | Approved: $approved"
  echo "---"

  local executed=()
  local skipped=()
  local completed_ids=()

  # Execute in reverse order (undo last change first)
  for ((i=total-1; i>=0; i--)); do
    local name sql idempotent requires_approval
    name=$(jq -r ".[$i].name" "$steps_file")
    sql=$(jq -r ".[$i].sql" "$steps_file")
    idempotent=$(jq -r ".[$i].idempotent" "$steps_file")
    requires_approval=$(jq -r ".[$i].requires_approval" "$steps_file")

    # Skip already-executed idempotent steps
    if [[ "$idempotent" == "true" ]]; then
      local already_done=false
      for done_id in "${completed_ids[@]}"; do
        if [[ "$done_id" == "$name" ]]; then
          already_done=true
          break
        fi
      done
      if $already_done; then
        echo "[SKIPPED] $name (already executed, idempotent)"
        skipped+=("$name")
        continue
      fi
    fi

    # Skip unapproved steps
    if [[ "$requires_approval" == "true" && "$approved" != "true" ]]; then
      echo "[SKIPPED] $name (requires manual approval)"
      skipped+=("$name")
      continue
    fi

    if [[ "$dry_run" == true ]]; then
      echo "[DRY RUN] $name: $sql"
      executed+=("$name")
      if [[ "$idempotent" == "true" ]]; then
        completed_ids+=("$name")
      fi
    else
      echo "[EXECUTING] $name: $sql"
      if psql -h "$DB_HOST" -d "$DB_NAME" -U "$DB_USER" -c "$sql" 2>&1; then
        echo "  ✅ Executed successfully"
        executed+=("$name")
        if [[ "$idempotent" == "true" ]]; then
          completed_ids+=("$name")
        fi
      else
        echo "  ❌ Failed — stopping rollback"
        return 1
      fi
    fi
  done

  echo "---"
  echo "Executed: ${executed[*]}"
  echo "Skipped: ${skipped[*]}"
  echo "=== Data Rollback Complete ==="
}

# --- Create rollback steps for schema changes ---
create_schema_rollback() {
  local table=$1 migration_backfilled=$2

  if [[ "$migration_backfilled" == true ]]; then

[
  {"name": "warn_no_data_rollback", "sql": "-- WARNING: dropping unbackfilled columns loses data", "idempotent": false, "requires_approval": true},
  {"name": "drop_columns", "sql": "ALTER TABLE $table DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS new_column", "idempotent": true, "requires_approval": true}
]
EOF
  fi
}

# --- Create rollback steps for data migrations ---
create_data_migration_rollback() {
  local source_format=$1 target_format=$2 backfill_complete=$3

  if [[ "$backfill_complete" == true ]]; then
    # All data is in new format — safe to revert
    echo "[{\"name\": \"revert_data_format\", \"sql\": \"-- Revert from $target_format to $source_format\", \"idempotent\": false, \"requires_approval\": false}]"
  else
    # Not all data migrated — old code must handle both formats
    echo "[{\"name\": \"dual_format_read\", \"sql\": \"-- Ensure both $source_format and $target_format are readable\", \"idempotent\": true, \"requires_approval\": false}]"

# --- Usage ---

# execute_data_rollback "$ROLLBACK_STEPS_FILE" false true
# create_data_migration_rollback "old_format" "new_format" true > "$ROLLBACK_STEPS_FILE"
```

### Pattern 3: Partial Rollback for Multi-Service Deployments

Handle partial rollback when only some services in a deployment need to revert.

#### ❌ BAD — All-or-Nothing Rollback

```bash
# ❌ BAD: Rolling back ALL services even when only one failed
# Unnecessary rollback of working services increases blast radius
SERVICES=("payment-service" "user-service" "order-service" "notification-service")
for service in "${SERVICES[@]}"; do
  kubectl rollout undo deployment/$service
done
# Problem: services that deployed successfully are needlessly rolled back
# Problem: other services that work fine lose their new features
# Problem: the rollback takes longer because more services revert
# Problem: more services in flux = higher chance of new failures
```

#### ✅ GOOD — Partial Rollback with Dependency Safety

```bash
# ✅ GOOD: Partial rollback — only rollback failed services
# Keep working services running, verify compatibility between mixed versions

# --- Configuration ---
STATE_FILE="/tmp/deployment-state/rolling.json"
COMPAT_FILE="/tmp/compatibility-windows.json"
PREVIOUS_VERSIONS_FILE="/tmp/previous-versions.json"

# --- Get service versions from cluster ---
get_service_versions() {

    if [[ -n "$version" ]]; then
      versions=$(echo "$versions" | jq --arg s "$service" --arg v "$version" '. + {($s): $v}')
    fi
  done
  echo "$versions"
}

# --- Get previous versions from deployment history ---
get_previous_version() {
  local service=$1

## Constraints

### MUST DO

- **Define automated rollback triggers before every deployment** — Manual rollback is too slow for user-facing failures
- **Test rollback procedures quarterly** — Untested rollback procedures are false confidence
- **Plan data rollback before deployment** — If you can't reverse the data change, you can't safely rollback
- **Implement partial rollback for multi-service deployments** — Don't rollback working services
- **Verify rollback completeness** — Monitor for 5+ minutes after rollback to confirm full recovery
- **Document rollback RTO and validate against it** — Know your recovery time objective

### MUST NOT DO

- **Never deploy without a rollback plan** — Deployment without rollback is not engineering
- **Never use non-idempotent rollback on production** — Retrying a failed rollback may cause data corruption
- **Never rollback data without verifying old code can read it** — Rolling back code that can't read the data is useless
- **Never skip cooldown between automatic rollbacks** — Rollback storms amplify failures
- **Never assume rollback is free** — Rollback has performance cost during data migration; plan for it

---

## Philosophy Alignment

This skill adheres to the **5 Laws of Elegant Defense**:

### Early Exit
- Rollback triggers evaluated continuously — any breach exits deployment immediately
- Non-idempotent rollback steps require manual approval — safety gate before execution

### Parse Don't Validate
- Rollback steps are parsed from declarative configuration
- Compatibility checking uses pre-parsed version pairs

### Atomic Predictability
- Each rollback step is independently testable
- Partial rollback decisions are pure functions — same failed services + same compatibility matrix = same rollback plan

### Fail Fast
- Any health trigger breach initiates rollback immediately — no waiting
- Cooldown prevents rollback storms — failure cascades are blocked early

### Intentional Naming
- `RollbackController`, `DataRollbackManager`, `PartialRollbackEngine` — names communicate scope
- `execute_partial_rollback()` vs `plan_rollback()` — planning vs execution is explicit
