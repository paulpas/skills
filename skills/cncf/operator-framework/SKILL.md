## Purpose and Use Cases

Operator Framework is a core component of the cloud-native ecosystem, serving as standardized patterns

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Operator Framework addresses the challenge of creating and managing Kubernetes operators with consistent patterns. It provides standardized operator lifecycle, automated upgrades, and operational best practices.

### When to Use This Project

Use Operator Framework when building custom operators, managing stateful applications, or requiring complex application lifecycle management. Not ideal for simple deployments or when need automated operations for applications, manage complex stateful workloads, or require lifecycle automation.

### Key Use Cases

- Database Operators for Kubernetes
- Logging Stack Operators
- Service Mesh Operators
- Machine Learning Operators
- Custom Application Operators

---

## Architecture Design Patterns

### Core Components

- **OLM**: Operator Lifecycle Manager for deployment
- **CSV**: ClusterServiceVersion for operator metadata
- **Bundle**: Operator package format
- **Catalog Source**: Repository of operators
- **Operator Lifecycle Controller**: Manages operator lifecycle

### Component Interactions

1. **Bundle → Catalog**: Bundle added to operator catalog
1. **OLM → Catalog**: OLM fetches operator metadata
1. **OLM → Operator**: OLM deploys operator
1. **Operator → Application**: Operator manages application

### Data Flow Patterns

1. **Bundle Creation**: Operator code → CSV → Bundle → Catalog
1. **Deployment**: OLM reads catalog → Creates installation plan → Deploys operator
1. **Upgrade**: New CSV detected → Installation plan → Upgrade operator
1. **Status Sync**: Operator status → OLM → Displayed in console

### Design Principles

- **Lifecycle Management**: Automated installation and upgrades
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic handling of dependencies
- **Declarative Installation**: Install plans as YAML
- **Upgrade Safety**: Safe, staged upgrades

---

## Integration Approaches

### Integration with Other CNCF Projects

- **Kubernetes**: Core platform for operator execution
- **Helm**: Helm chart support for operators
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
- **OpenShift**: Integrated operator management

### API Patterns

- **CRDs**: Define custom resources for operator
- **API Groups**: Versioned API groups
- **Subscriptions**: Operator subscription management
- **InstallPlans**: Automatic installation plans

### Configuration Patterns

- **Bundle YAML**: Operator package format
- **CatalogSource YAML**: Catalog configuration
- **Subscription YAML**: Operator subscription
- **Helm Chart**: Helm-based operator packaging

### Extension Mechanisms

- **Custom Managers**: Manage additional APIs
- **Webhook Injection**: Add admission webhooks

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Misconfigurations

- **Bundle Validation**: Bundle not passing validation
  - **How to Avoid**: Use operator-sdk bundle validate, check manifest requirements
- **Upgrade Blocking**: Upgrade blocked by validation
  - **How to Avoid**: Review upgrade path, fix validation issues

### Performance Issues

- **RBAC Issues**: Insufficient permissions for operator
  - **How to Avoid**: Review ClusterRoles, use least privilege
- **Operator State**: Operator in failed state
  - **How to Avoid**: Review operator logs, check CR status

### Operational Challenges

- **Dependency Resolution**: Dependencies not resolved
  - **How to Avoid**: Define operator dependencies clearly
- **CR Migration**: CR migration issues during upgrade
  - **How to Avoid**: Implement CRD migration strategy

### Security Pitfalls

- **InstallPlan**: Installation plan

### Lifecycle Management

- **Bundle Creation**: Write operator → Create bundle → Push to catalog
- **Operator Installation**: Create subscription → OLM createsInstallPlan → Operator deployed
- **Operator Upgrade**: New CSV available → OLM creates new InstallPlan → Upgrade operator
- **Operator Removal**: Delete subscription → Operator undeployed

### State Management

- **Bundle State**: Valid, invalid, or pending
- **Subscription State**: Installed, failed, or upgrading
- **InstallPlan State**: Installed, complete, or failed
- **Operator State**: Running, error, or stopped

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- **Integrating a CNCF project into Kubernetes infrastructure** — You need to configure, deploy, or troubleshoot a cloud-native tool within a cluster
- **Designing cloud-native architecture** — You are selecting and integrating CNCF tools to solve specific infrastructure challenges
- **Resolving operational issues** — A CNCF component is misbehaving, underperforming, or needs configuration changes
---

## Core Workflow

1. **Assess Requirements** — Understand the use case, scale, integration needs, and existing infrastructure. **Checkpoint:** Document requirements, constraints, and success criteria.

2. **Design Architecture** — Plan component interactions, data flow, and deployment strategy using cloud-native best practices. **Checkpoint:** Verify the architecture addresses all requirements and follows CNCF conventions.

3. **Implement & Configure** — Create manifests, configurations, and deployment scripts. Include resource limits, health checks, and observability hooks. **Checkpoint:** Validate all YAML against schema and test in a staging environment.

4. **Deploy & Monitor** — Apply manifests to the cluster, verify component health, and confirm observability is working. **Checkpoint:** Confirm all pods/services are running, probes passing, and metrics/alerts configured.

---

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- Include at least one complete working YAML manifest example
- Note when content is auto-generated vs. manually verified
- Reference relevant CNCF project documentation

### MUST NOT DO
- Deploy manifests without testing in a staging environment first
- Use deprecated API versions (e.g., apps/v1beta1)
- Omit resource limits and requests in Kubernetes manifests
