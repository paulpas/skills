# Programming Algorithms: A Comprehensive Guide for Algorithm Selection

**Role:** Senior Algorithm Engineer — select, implement, and optimize algorithms for problem-solving across domains.

**Philosophy:** Algorithmic Precision — choose the right tool for the job based on time/space trade-offs, input characteristics, and problem constraints. No fabrication — leverage established, proven algorithms.

## Purpose: Why Standard Algorithms

**The Problem with Fabrication:**
- Reinventing algorithms introduces bugs and suboptimal solutions
- Standard algorithms have decades of academic analysis and optimization
- Edge cases are already understood and handled
- Performance characteristics are well-documented

**When to Use Standard Algorithms:**
1. Problem matches a known pattern (sorting, shortest path, etc.)
2. Input size suggests complexity constraints
3. Resource limits (time/space) are known
4. Industry standards exist for the domain

**Key Principles:**
- **Trade-offs are inevitable:** Time vs space, simplicity vs performance
- **Context matters:** Input size, distribution, and constraints dictate choices
- **Proof first, optimize later:** Ensure correctness before micro-optimizations

    # Base cases
    dp[base_case] = base_value
    
    # State transition
    for state in problem_space:
        for choice in valid_choices(state):
            dp[state] = optimal(dp[state], transition(dp[previous_state], choice))

        if sorted_array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif sorted_array[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1

    result = [process(window)]
    
    # Slide window
    for i in range(k, n):
        remove_old(arr[i - k], window)

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        px, py = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if px == py:
            return False
        
        # Union by rank
        if self.rank[px] < self.rank[py]:
            px, py = py, px
        self.parent[py] = px
        if self.rank[px] == self.rank[py]:

    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        # Maintain decreasing/increasing property
        while stack and compare(stack[-1], num):
            idx = stack.pop()
            result[idx] = num  # or process
        
        stack.append(i)
    
    return result

## Common Pitfalls

### Dynamic Programming Pitfalls
1. **Wrong State Definition**: Define state precisely. `dp[i][j]` should have clear meaning.
2. **Incorrect Base Cases**: Test with small inputs. Edge cases often fail.
3. **Off-by-One Errors**: Arrays vs indices. `dp[0]` vs `dp[1]`.
4. **Missing Transitions**: Ensure all valid states are reachable.
5. **Space Optimization Bugs**: When reducing to 1D, ensure no used values are overwritten.
6. **Order Matters**: Top-down needs correct recursion order. Bottom-up needs correct iteration order.

### Backtracking Pitfalls
1. **Missing Pruning**: Without pruning, exponential time. Prune early when possible.
2. **State Not Restored**: Always undo moves after recursive call.
3. **Duplicate Solutions**: Use set or careful ordering to avoid duplicates.
4. **Incorrect Termination**: Base case should check complete solution.
5. **Memory Leaks**: Large state objects not cleaned up.

### Graph Algorithm Pitfalls
1. **Indexing Confusion**: 0-indexed vs 1-indexed. Consistency matters.
2. **Undirected vs Directed**: Edge direction affects algorithm choice.
3. **Disconnected Graphs**: Handle multiple components.
4. **Negative Cycles**: Bellman-Ford detects, Dijkstra doesn't.
5. **Memory Limits**: Adjacency matrix O(V²) vs list O(V + E).

### String Algorithm Pitfalls
1. **Index Bounds**: String indexing can be tricky with encoding.
2. **Off-by-One in LPS**: LPS array construction often has off-by-one.
3. **Hash Collisions**: Rabin-Karp needs good hash function.
4. **Pattern Empty**: Handle edge case of empty pattern.
5. **Unicode Issues**: Consider character vs byte length.

### Mathematical Algorithm Pitfalls
1. **Overflow**: Intermediate calculations may overflow. Use mod carefully.
2. **Division in Modular**: Multiply by modular inverse, not divide.
3. **Floating Point Precision**: Newton's method may not converge perfectly.
4. **Matrix Singularity**: Check for zero pivot in Gaussian elimination.
5. **Edge Cases**: GCD(0, x) = x, power(x, 0) = 1.

### Greedy Algorithm Pitfalls
1. **Greedy Doesn't Always Work**: Prove greedy choice property first.
2. **Local vs Global Optimum**: Greedy finds local, may not be global.
3. **Sorting Overhead**: Sometimes sorting is the answer, not just a step.
4. **Weighted Cases**: Standard greedy fails; need DP or other approach.

### Numerical Algorithm Pitfalls
1. **Division by Zero**: Newton's method can hit zero derivative.
2. **Convergence**: Not all methods converge for all functions.
3. **Stiff Equations**: Standard ODE solvers may fail; use stiff solvers.
4. **Round-off Error**: Accumulated in iterative methods.
5. **Initial Guess**: Newton's method is sensitive to starting point.

### Probabilistic Algorithm Pitfalls
1. **False Positives/Negatives**: Understand and handle them.
2. **Seed Quality**: Randomness quality affects results.
3. **Error Bounds**: Understand and communicate error tolerance.
4. **Space-Time Tradeoff**: Higher accuracy uses more space.
5. **Deterministic Alternative**: Sometimes deterministic is faster.

### Implementation Pitfalls
1. **Integer Division**: Use // in Python, be careful with casting.
2. **Off-by-One in Loops**: `i < n` vs `i <= n`.
3. **Mutable Defaults**: Don't use mutable objects as default arguments.
4. **Pass by Reference**: Ensure copying when needed.
5. **Edge Cases**: Always test with empty input, single element, max size.
