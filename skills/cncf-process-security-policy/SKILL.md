# CNCF Security Policy Process

Creates or updates `SECURITY.md` with the project's vulnerability reporting channel, supported versions matrix, and response timeline.

## When to Use

Use when:
- A CNCF incubating or graduating project does not yet have a `SECURITY.md`
- The existing `SECURITY.md` is missing the reporting channel, response SLA, or supported versions
- A project is working toward an OpenSSF Best Practices badge (requires a security disclosure policy)

Do NOT use when:
- The repository is documentation-only with no executable code — link to the parent project's SECURITY.md instead

## Steps

1. **Fetch the template.**
   If GitHub MCP available: `github_get_contents` path=`cncf/tag-security/main/project-resources/templates/SECURITY.md`
   Otherwise: `gh api repos/cncf/tag-security/contents/project-resources/templates/SECURITY.md`

2. **Fill in Reporting a Vulnerability:**
   - Primary: GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting
     (`Settings → Code security → Private vulnerability reporting → Enable`)
   - Fallback: security@<project>.io or security@lists.cncf.io
   ⚠️ Never direct reporters to a public GitHub issue — this exposes the vulnerability before a patch exists.

3. **Fill in Supported Versions table.** Mark EOL versions clearly.
   ⚠️ Define how a version reaches EOL, or link to RELEASES.md that does.

4. **Fill in Response Timeline** (CNCF recommended):
   - Acknowledge: within 2 business days
   - Triage + severity: within 5 business days
   - Patch + coordinated disclosure: within 90 days (non-critical) / 7 days (critical)
   ⚠️ All dates must use UTC to avoid timezone ambiguity with downstream distributors.

5. **Enable GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** in repo settings if not already on:
   `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/settings/security_analysis`

6. **Set up OpenSSF tooling.** See the `openssf-scorecards` and `openssf-badge` skills.

7. **Remove all TODO markers and instruction links.**

## Checklist
