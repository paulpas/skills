# S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Configure durable, scalable object storage with versioning, lifecycle management, and encryption. S3 provides unlimited, cost-effective storage for any data type with sophisticated access controls.

## TL;DR Checklist

- [ ] Enable versioning for data protection and rollback
- [ ] Configure lifecycle policies to transition old objects to cheaper storage classes
- [ ] Enable encryption at rest (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or client-side)
- [ ] Implement bucket policies with principle of least privilege
- [ ] Enable block public access for all buckets by default
- [ ] Enable MFA delete for critical buckets
- [ ] Configure access logging to CloudWatch or another bucket
- [ ] Use S3 Object Lock for compliance requirements
- [ ] Enable CloudTrail logging for API audit trail
- [ ] Configure intelligent tiering for automatic cost optimization

---

## When to Use

Use S3 when:

- Storing large files or unstructured data (images, videos, documents, backups)
- Requiring highly durable, geographically distributed storage (11 9's of durability)
- Hosting static websites or serving content via CloudFront
- Storing application backups, database snapshots, or disaster recovery data
- Building data lakes or data warehouses
- Needing versioning and point-in-time recovery
- Sharing objects with fine-grained access control

---

## When NOT to Use

Avoid S3 when:

- Requiring microsecond latency (use ElastiCache or DynamoDB instead)
- Building highly structured relational databases (use RDS instead)
- Needing file system semantics with POSIX permissions (use EFS instead)
- Working with streaming data requiring low latency (use Kinesis instead)

---

## Purpose and Use Cases

**Primary Purpose:** Provide infinitely scalable, durable object storage with automatic data protection, lifecycle management, and sophisticated access controls.

**Common Use Cases:**

1. **Backup and Disaster Recovery** — Store database backups, EC2 snapshots, and recovery data
2. **Data Lake** — Centralized repository for structured and unstructured data
3. **Static Website Hosting** — Host HTML, CSS, JavaScript with CloudFront integration
4. **Log Storage** — Aggregate application, security, and access logs
5. **Content Distribution** — Source for CloudFront CDN
6. **Data Archival** — Long-term storage with Glacier for compliance
7. **Application Data** — User uploads, generated reports, processed outputs

                  - s3:ReplicateDelete
                Resource: !Sub '${ReplicaBucket.Arn}/*'
```

**Key Elements:**

## Integration Approaches

### 1. Integration with CloudFront

S3 + CloudFront provides:
- Global content distribution with edge caching
- Reduced S3 API costs (CloudFront caches responses)
- DDoS protection via CloudFront
- Origin Access Identity for secure bucket access

### 2. Integration with Lambda

S3 events trigger Lambda functions for:
- Image resizing and transformation
- Document processing (PDF conversion, OCR)
- Log analysis and alerts
- Data transformation pipelines

### 3. Integration with Athena and Glue

Query S3 data directly via SQL:
- Athena for ad-hoc SQL queries on CSV, JSON, Parquet
- Glue Crawler to auto-discover schema
- No data movement required (query in-place)

### 4. Integration with CloudTrail

Enable CloudTrail for S3 API auditing:
- Track all API calls (GetObject, PutObject, DeleteObject)
- Compliance and forensics investigations
- Unauthorized access detection

### 5. Integration with IAM and KMS

Fine-grained access control:
- IAM policies for user/role permissions
- Bucket policies for public/cross-account access
- KMS encryption with customer-managed keys
- Resource-based policies for least privilege

---

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Buckets Not Versioned

**Problem:** Accidental deletions or overwrites are permanent; no rollback possible.

**Solution:**
- Enable versioning on all production buckets
- Combine with lifecycle rules to manage version storage costs
- Use Object Lock for compliance requirements

### ❌ Pitfall 2: No Lifecycle Management

**Problem:** All data stored in S3 Standard costs $0.023/GB/month; old data accumulates.

**Solution:**
- Transition to Intelligent-Tiering after 30 days (automatic optimization)
- Move to Glacier/Deep Archive after 90 days for long-term retention
- Set expiration policies for temporary data
- Regular cost analysis via S3 Storage Lens

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Public Buckets Exposing Sensitive Data

**Problem:** Bucket misconfiguration exposes credentials, keys, or PII.

**Solution:**
- Enable block public access on all buckets by default
- Use bucket policies to restrict access
- Never use public ACLs
- Regular security audits via S3 Block Public Access

### ❌ Pitfall 4: No Encryption

**Problem:** Data at rest is unencrypted; fails compliance requirements.

**Solution:**
- Enable default encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)
- Use bucket policies to deny unencrypted uploads
- Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data
- Enable encryption for snapshots and replicas

### ❌ Pitfall 5: Not Monitoring Access

**Problem:** Unauthorized access goes undetected; compliance violations.

**Solution:**
- Enable access logging to CloudWatch
- Configure S3 Storage Lens for analytics
- Enable CloudTrail for API audit trail
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for suspicious patterns

### ❌ Pitfall 6: Missing Multi-Region Replication

**Problem:** Regional outage loses all data; no disaster recovery.

**Solution:**
- Enable S3 replication to secondary region for critical data
- Use Object Lock in replica bucket for immutability
- Test failover procedures regularly

---

## Best Practices Summary

| Category | Best Practice |
|---|---|
| **Durability** | Enable versioning; replicate to secondary region |
| **Cost** | Use Intelligent-Tiering; expire old versions |
| **Security** | Block public access; enforce encrypted transport; use KMS |
| **Compliance** | Enable CloudTrail; use Object Lock; implement retention policies |
| **Performance** | Use CloudFront for distribution; S3 Transfer Acceleration for large uploads |
| **Monitoring** | Enable access logging; configure CloudWatch alarms |
