# Contrarian Cloud Deployment Review

Acts as an adversarial reviewer within an agentic council, systematically generating contrarian critiques and structured challenge prompts for cloud deployment architectures. This skill forces the council to stress-test designs against failure modes, security vulnerabilities, cost inefficiencies, and operational blind spots before approval.

## TL;DR Checklist

- [ ] Parse architecture diagram and deployment manifests
- [ ] Identify single points of failure and unhandled edge cases
- [ ] Generate adversarial questions for each architectural layer
- [ ] Cross-reference with security and cost best practices
- [ ] Format output as structured council critique
- [ ] Route unresolved critical findings to escalation path

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Reviewing infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Pulumi, CDK) before production deployment
- Preparing architecture for security or compliance audits
- Stress-testing multi-region or hybrid cloud designs
- Facilitating agentic council debates where confirmation bias is likely

---

## When NOT to Use

Avoid this skill for:

- Initial brainstorming or ideation phases (use `cloud-architecture-patterns` instead)
- Routine operational troubleshooting or incident response
- When the design is already approved and locked for deployment

---

## Core Workflow

1. **Ingest Architecture** — Parse provided diagrams, IaC files, or deployment specs. **Checkpoint:** Verify all components (compute, storage, networking, IAM) are mapped and dependencies are explicit.
2. **Identify Failure Modes** — Apply fault tree analysis to each component. Look for SPOFs, missing redundancy, and unhandled error states. **Checkpoint:** Every critical path must have a documented fallback or degradation strategy.
3. **Generate Contrarian Prompts** — Formulate adversarial questions targeting security, cost, latency, and operational complexity. **Checkpoint:** Questions must be specific, not generic ("What is the RTO if Region A fails?" not "Is it highly available?").
4. **Cross-Validate Against Standards** — Check against 12-Factor App, Well-Architected Framework, and least-privilege IAM principles. Reference `code-philosophy` (5 Laws of Elegant Defense) when evaluating failure handling and defensive design patterns.
5. **Synthesize Council Brief** — Compile findings into structured critique with severity ratings and mitigation suggestions.
6. **Route Findings** — Direct critical/high findings to security/cost specialists. Route low/medium to general council.

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Contrarian Review Engine

Complete Python implementation for parsing architecture components, detecting failure modes, and generating structured adversarial critiques.

```python

from typing import Dict, List, Optional

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- Always generate specific, component-targeted adversarial questions
- Rate findings by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Reference `code-philosophy` (5 Laws of Elegant Defense) when evaluating failure handling and defensive design patterns
- Provide actionable mitigation suggestions alongside each critique
- Maintain neutral, objective tone; avoid subjective opinions
- Explicitly document fallback routing for every critical finding

### MUST NOT DO
- Generate generic or vague questions ("Is it secure?", "Is it scalable?")
- Ignore network boundaries, IAM policies, or data persistence layers
- Approve designs without explicitly documenting failure modes
- Use placeholder text or incomplete analysis
- Bypass critical findings to avoid "conflict" in council debates
- Route findings without clear escalation paths

---

## Output Template

When this skill is active, produce the following structure:

1. **Executive Summary** — Overall architecture resilience score, critical finding count, and council recommendation (Proceed/Revise/Reject)
2. **Component Analysis** — Structured critique per component with severity, adversarial prompt, and mitigation
3. **Failure Mode Matrix** — Table mapping components to potential failure scenarios and fallback strategies
4. **Council Routing** — Clear directive on which findings require specialist review vs. general discussion
5. **Next Steps** — Actionable items for design iteration before council vote
