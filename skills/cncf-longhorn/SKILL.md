## Purpose and Use Cases

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Longhorn addresses the critical gap in Kubernetes-native storage by providing a distributed block storage system that integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes. Traditional storage solutions were either cloud-specific, complex to deploy, or lacked Kubernetes-native features like automated failover, backups, and snapshots.

### When to Use This Project

Use Longhorn when you need:
- Kubernetes-native block storage with PVC support
- Automatic data replication across nodes
- Built-in backup and disaster recovery
- Storage class integration with dynamic provisioning
- High availability for stateful workloads
- Easy management through Kubernetes APIs

### Key Use Cases

- **Database Storage**: Run PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB with persistent, replicated storage
- **Stateful Applications**: Deploy Redis, Elasticsearch, Kafka with reliable storage
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Store build artifacts and caches with redundancy
- **AI/ML Workloads**: Provide high-throughput storage for training data
- **Backup and DR**: Automated snapshots and off-cluster backups
- **Multi-Cluster Storage**: Sync data across multiple Kubernetes clusters

---

## Architecture Design Patterns

### Core Components

- **Engine**: Handles block device operations and data replication
- **Replica**: Individual copy of volume data on a node
- **Controller**: Manages the engine and coordinates replication
- **Instance Manager**: Manages engine and replica processes
- **Driver**: Kubernetes CSI driver for volume provisioning
- **Scheduler**: Schedules volumes to nodes with available resources
- **Reconciler**: Ensures desired state matches actual state
- **Backup Controller**: Manages backup creation and restoration

### Component Interactions

1. **User → Kubernetes API**: Create PVC requesting Longhorn storage
2. **Provisioner → Controller**: Volume provisioning request
3. **Controller → Engine**: Engine management for block device
4. **Engine → Replicas**: Data write operations to all replicas
5. **Replica → Instance Manager**: Process lifecycle management
6. **Instance Manager → Node**: Schedule processes on appropriate nodes
7. **Reconciler → All Components**: Continuously sync desired state
8. **Backup Controller → Object Store**: Off-cluster backup storage

### Data Flow Patterns

1. **Volume Creation**: PVC request → Provisioner → Controller → Engine → Replicas → Storage
2. **Write Operation**: Application → Block device → Engine → Replicas (parallel writes)
3. **Read Operation**: Application → Block device → Engine → Replica (quorum read)
4. **Rebuild Process**: Failed replica detected → New replica created → Data synced from healthy replicas
5. **Backup Process**: Trigger backup → Create snapshot → Send to object store → Update backup metadata
6. **Restore Process**: Restore backup → Download from object store → Create replica → Sync to engine

### Design Principles

- **Kubernetes-Native**: Full CSI driver integration
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery from node and disk failures
- **Data Redundancy**: Configurable replica count with automatic rebuild
- **Decoupled Architecture**: Engine and replica separation for flexibility
- **Conflict Detection**: Detect and prevent split-brain scenarios
- **Backup Integration**: Native integration with S3-compatible storage

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Configuration Issues

- **Insufficient Disk Space**: Monitor free space and configure cleanup policies
- **Replica Scheduling**: Ensure enough nodes have available disk space
- **Network Partition**: Configure proper network and firewall rules between nodes
- **Backup Configuration**: Verify S3 credentials and bucket accessibility
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate resource requests for engines and replicas

### Performance Issues

- **Slow I/O**: Check disk utilization and network connectivity between nodes
- **Rebuild Delays**: Monitor rebuild progress and adjust priority
- **Snapshot Overhead**: Limit snapshot count and frequency
- **Engine Contention**: Avoid overprovisioning engines on single node
- **Network Bottleneck**: Use dedicated network for replica communication

### Operational Challenges

- **Node Failure**: Implement automated recovery and monitoring
- **Disk Failure**: Replace failed disks and trigger rebuilds
- **Data Corruption**: Use checksums and detect silent corruption
- **Backup Failures**: Monitor backup status and retry mechanisms
- **Upgrade Complexity**: Plan upgrades carefully with rollback strategies

### Security Pitfalls

- **Access Control**: Restrict access to Longhorn API and backend storage
- **Secret Management**: Use Kubernetes secrets for credentials
- **Encryption**: Enable encryption at rest for sensitive data
- **Network Security**: Isolate storage network from public access
- **Audit Logging**: Enable audit logs for compliance

## Coding Practices

### Idiomatic Configuration

- **StorageClass Parameters**: Use specific Longhorn parameters for fine-grained control
- **Volume Settings**: Configure settings at volume level for specific workloads
- **Node Management**: Tag nodes for storage pool organization
- **Backup Policies**: Define backup schedules and retention policies

### API Usage Patterns

- **PVC Creation**: Standard Kubernetes PVC with Longhorn StorageClass
- **Snapshot Management**: Create and manage snapshots through Kubernetes API
- **Backup Operations**: Trigger backups via Longhorn API or Kubernetes Snapshot
- **Restore Operations**: Restore from backup through Longhorn API
- **Volume Expansion**: Expand PVC and trigger volume expansion

### Observability Best Practices

- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus scrape Longhorn metrics endpoint
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for disk space, replica status, and rebuild status
- **Dashboard**: Use pre-built Grafana dashboards for storage monitoring
- **Log Analysis**: Monitor Longhorn component logs for issues
- **Health Checks**: Implement automated health checks for storage availability

### Development Workflow

- **Local Development**: Use Longhorn for local Kubernetes storage needs
- **Testing**: Test storage operations in staging environment
- **CI/CD Integration**: Provision storage for CI/CD workloads
- **Disaster Recovery**: Test backup and restore procedures regularly

- **Replica State**: Running, stopped, error, unknown
- **Engine State**: Running, stopped, error, unknown
- **Backup State**: Created, creating, error, completed
