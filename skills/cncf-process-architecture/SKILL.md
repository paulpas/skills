# CNCF Architecture Documentation Process

Creates or updates `ARCHITECTURE.md` explaining the project's major components, data flow, and key design decisions.

## When to Use

Use when:
- The project is preparing for incubating or graduation review and lacks a written architecture overview
- A new contributor asks "how does this project actually work?" with no single doc to point to
- A significant architectural change has been merged and the existing document is now stale

Do NOT use when:
- The project is a specification, not code — write a "How it works" section in README.md instead
- The project is extremely small (single binary, <1000 LOC) — a detailed README.md is sufficient

## Steps

1. **Identify major subsystems.** Read the top-level directory structure and README. List
   every package, binary, or module with a distinct responsibility. Aim for 3–10 subsystems.

2. **Draw a component diagram** in ASCII art (preferred — renders everywhere, no tooling needed):
   ```
   ┌─────────────┐   gRPC   ┌──────────────┐
   │   CLI/SDK   │ ──────── │  API Server  │
   └─────────────┘          └──────┬───────┘
                                   │ watches
                            ┌──────▼───────┐
                            │  Controller  │
                            └──────────────┘
   ```
   Label each arrow with the protocol or mechanism.
   ⚠️ Binary image files (PNG, SVG) go stale — use ASCII art or Mermaid in the Markdown source.

3. **Describe each component in 2–5 sentences:** what it does, what it owns, what it does NOT do.

4. **Document the primary data flow** as a numbered sequence for the most important user journey.

5. **List external dependencies:** databases, queues, cloud APIs, Kubernetes API server.
   For each: protocol, required or optional, behavior when unavailable.
   ⚠️ TAG Security reviewers specifically look for this list — missing it is a common finding.

6. **Document the deployment model:** supported topologies, Kubernetes namespace permissions
   if applicable, OS/arch support.
   ⚠️ Undocumented cluster-admin requirements are a red flag to TOC reviewers.

7. **Record extension points** (plugins, webhooks, CRDs). One sentence per extension point.

8. **Add one-sentence rationale for each major design decision.**
   ⚠️ A diagram without rationale tells reviewers what the project does but not whether the design is sound.

9. **State what is intentionally out of scope.**

10. **Add an update policy note** at the end: "Updated as part of any PR that changes the architecture."

11. **Cross-link from README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.**
