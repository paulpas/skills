# Secure Release Pipeline Manager

Implements comprehensive security controls throughout the software release lifecycle — from dependency scanning and code review to version management and incident response — ensuring zero compromises on security while maintaining delivery velocity.

## TL;DR Checklist

- [ ] Run all dependency CVE scanners (Snyk, Dependabot, Trivy) before any build
- [ ] Block releases if critical/high CVEs are present (severity thresholds)
- [ ] Run OWASP Top 10 coverage checks + SAST/DAST before merge
- [ ] Enforce semantic versioning: patches fix CVEs, minors add features, majors break compat
- [ ] Pin all production dependencies; lock transitive dependencies
- [ ] Execute multi-stage quality gates with automated approvals
- [ ] Block on critical issues; warn but allow on medium with approval
- [ ] Document and communicate any security incident within 1 hour

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Building or auditing a release pipeline for a production service
- Implementing automated security gates before deployments
- Establishing semantic versioning policies for security patches
- Designing incident response procedures for security vulnerabilities
- Creating version management policies for dependency updates

---

## When NOT to Use

Avoid this skill when:

- Developing experimental/throwaway code with no production deployment
- Working on internal tools with no security sensitivity (use simplified pipeline)
- Under extreme time pressure where security reviews are explicitly waived (document exception)
- Deploying to ephemeral development environments without security requirements

---

## Core Workflow

1. **Pre-Build: Dependency Scanning** — Scan all dependencies for known CVEs using multiple tools (Snyk, Dependabot, Trivy). **Checkpoint:** No critical/high CVEs in dependencies before proceeding.

2. **Pre-Merge: Security Code Review** — Run SAST on all code changes, enforce OWASP Top 10 coverage, require peer review for security-sensitive changes. **Checkpoint:** All high-severity security issues resolved or explicitly accepted.

3. **Pre-Release: Semantic Versioning** — Apply semantic versioning based on change type: patch (CVE fixes), minor (features, non-breaking), major (breaking changes). **Checkpoint:** Version bump aligns with change type and security impact.

4. **Post-Unit Tests: Quality Gates** — Execute multi-stage quality checks: unit tests, integration tests, SAST, DAST. **Checkpoint:** All blocking criteria passed; warnings documented and accepted.

5. **Post-Release: Monitoring & Response** — Monitor deployed releases for security issues. **Checkpoint:** Any critical vulnerability triggers immediate incident response process.

## Implementation Patterns / Reference Guide

### Pattern 1: Multi-Tool Dependency Scanning

Use multiple CVE scanners to maximize coverage — each tool has different vulnerability databases and detection algorithms.

**Example: Combined Snyk + Dependabot + Trivy Workflow**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/dependency-scan.yaml
name: Dependency Security Scan

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  scan-dependencies:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Snyk - comprehensive CVE database + dependency graph
      - name: Run Snyk Security Scan
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: --severity-threshold=high

      # Dependabot - GitHub's native scanner with detailed fix recommendations
      - name: Check Dependabot Alerts
        run: |
          curl -H "Authorization: token ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" \
               https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.repository }}/dependency-graph/snapshots \
               | jq '.snapshots[] | select(.ecosystem == "npm")'

      # Trivy - container image and file system scanning
      - name: Run Trivy Filesystem Scan
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          scan-type: 'fs'
          scan-ref: '.'
          format: 'sarif'
          output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
          severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'

      # Gate: Block if critical/high vulnerabilities found
      - name: Security Gate Check
        run: |
          if grep -q '"severity": "CRITICAL"\|"severity": "HIGH"' trivy-results.sarif; then
            echo "❌ Blocking release: Critical/High CVEs detected"
            exit 1
          fi
```

**Best Practices:**
- Run Snyk with `--severity-threshold=high` (block on critical/high)
- Configure Dependabot to open PRs automatically for vulnerable dependencies
- Use Trivy to scan both codebase filesystem and container images
- Aggregate results and fail on any critical or high severity finding

---

### Pattern 2: Security Code Review with SAST

Automated static analysis should catch common vulnerabilities before human review.

**Example: SonarQube + Semgrep Integration**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-review.yaml
name: Security Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, release/*]

jobs:
  sast-analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      # Semgrep - fast, rule-based SAST for OWASP Top 10
      - name: Run Semgrep OWASP Top 10
        uses: returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1
        with:
          config: |
            p/security-audit
            p/owasp-top-ten
            p/semgrep-rule-repository
          severity: error,warn

      # SonarQube - comprehensive analysis with security rules
      - name: Run SonarQube Scan
        uses: SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action@v4
        env:
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
          SONAR_HOST_URL: ${{ secrets.SONAR_HOST_URL }}
        with:
          projectKey: ${{ github.repository }}
          extraProperties: |
            sonar.qualitygate.wait=true
            sonar.security.hotspots.review.priority=HIGH
            sonar.cfamily.compile-commands=compile_commands.json

      # Security Gate: Block on criticalSonar issues
      - name: Security Gate Check
        run: |
          if [ "${{ steps.sonarqube.outputs.qualitygate }}" != "OK" ]; then
            echo "❌ Security Gate Failed: SonarQube quality gate not passed"
            exit 1
          fi

          # Check for critical Semgrep findings
          semgrep_output=$(cat semgrep.json 2>/dev/null || echo "{}")
          if echo "$semgrep_output" | jq -e '.results[] | select(.severity == "ERROR")' | grep -q .; then
            echo "❌ Blocking: Critical Semgrep findings detected"
            exit 1
          fi
```

**Best Practices:**
- Run Semgrep with `p/security-audit` and `p/owasp-top-ten` config packs
- Configure SonarQube to wait for quality gate status
- Block on any ERROR severity findings in Semgrep
- Require explicit acceptance for WARN findings with documented rationale

---

### Pattern 3: Semantic Versioning for Security Patches

Apply strict semantic versioning rules that prioritize security over feature development.

**Example: Version Bumping Policy**

```python
"""
Version Management for Secure Releases

Rules:
- PATCH: CVE fixes, security patches (no API changes)
- MINOR: New features, non-breaking changes, security enhancements
- MAJOR: Breaking changes, API removals, major refactorings

Security Patch Versioning:
- If CVE affects public API: MINOR bump (fix must be visible)
- If CVE is internal-only: PATCH bump
- Emergency security hotfixes: PATCH on latest stable, then merge to main
"""

from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum
from typing import List, Optional

class VersionBumpType(Enum):
    PATCH = "patch"      # CVE/security fixes, internal fixes
    MINOR = "minor"      # New features, non-breaking changes
    MAJOR = "major"      # Breaking changes, API modifications

@dataclass
class SecurityChange:
    """Represents a security-related change affecting versioning."""
    cve_ids: List[str]
    severity: str  # "critical", "high", "medium", "low"
    affects_api: bool

    fixed_by: str  # PR/commit reference

@dataclass
class VersionPolicy:
    """Security-aware semantic versioning policy."""
    minor_version: int = 0
    patch_version: int = 1

        """
        if not changes and not features:
            return VersionBumpType.PATCH  # No changes = patch for stability
        
        # Check for critical/high CVEs - always require at least MINOR
        has_critical_cve = any(c.severity in ("critical", "high") for c in changes)
        any_affects_api = any(c.affects_api for c in changes)
        
        if has_critical_cve:

            return VersionBumpType.MINOR  # Non-breaking but critical fix
        
        # High severity CVEs
        has_high_cve = any(c.severity == "high" for c in changes)
        if has_high_cve:
            return VersionBumpType.MINOR
        
        # Medium/low CVEs with API changes
        if any_affects_api:
            return VersionBumpType.MAJOR
        
        # Security fixes without API changes = PATCH
        if changes:
            return VersionBumpType.PATCH
        
        # No security changes, check for features
        if features:
            return VersionBumpType.MINOR
        
        return VersionBumpType.PATCH

# Example usage
def determine_security_version(changes: List[SecurityChange]) -> str:
    """Determine version string for security release."""
    policy = VersionPolicy()
    bump = policy.calculate_bump(changes, features=False)
    
    current_version = "1.2.3"  # Get from actual version source
    
    major, minor, patch = map(int, current_version.split("."))
    
    if bump == VersionBumpType.MAJOR:
        return f"{major + 1}.0.0"
    elif bump == VersionBumpType.MINOR:
        return f"{major}.{minor + 1}.0"
    else:
        return f"{major}.{minor}.{patch + 1}"

# Security patch version example
security_changes = [
    SecurityChange(
        cve_ids=["CVE-2024-1234"],
        severity="high",
        affects_api=False,
        description="RCE vulnerability in dependency",
        fixed_by="PR-#456"
    )
]

version = determine_security_version(security_changes)
print(f"Security release version: {version}")  # Output: 1.2.4 (PATCH bump)
```

**Best Practices:**
- Always bump MINOR or higher for critical/high CVEs
- Document CVE fixes in release notes with CVE IDs
- Create separate release branches for security patches
- Tag security releases with `-security` suffix when urgent

---

### Pattern 4: Multi-Stage Quality Gates

Implement blocking and warning criteria with automated approval workflows.

**Example: Quality Gate Implementation**

```python
"""
Quality Gate System

Blocking Criteria (must pass):
- All critical/high CVEs resolved
- All SAST ERROR findings resolved
- Security policy compliance
- No known security hotspots

Warning Criteria (can pass with approval):
- SAST WARN findings (documented)
- Medium severity CVEs (with risk acceptance)
- Performance degradation under threshold

**Best Practices:**
- Separate blocking and warning criteria clearly
- Allow warnings with documented approval (who approved, when, rationale)
- Provide automatic rollback capability if post-deployment monitoring detects issues

print(f"Timeline Events: {len(status['timeline'])}")
for event in status['timeline']:
    print(f"  [{event['timestamp']}] {event['event']}: {event['details']}")
```

**Best Practices:**
- All incidents logged with full timeline
- Critical incidents: full communication to affected customers
- Post-incident review within 5 business days
- Document lessons learned and update policies accordingly

## Constraints

### MUST DO

- Run CVE scanning on ALL dependencies before any build or release
- Block releases if critical or high severity CVEs are detected
- Apply semantic versioning: PATCH for CVE fixes, MINOR for features
- Enforce SAST analysis on all code changes with OWASP Top 10 coverage
- Document and track all security incidents with full audit trail
- Require explicit approval for any warning-level issues that are accepted
- Maintain backward compatibility for all MINOR version updates
- Pin all production dependencies and lock transitive dependencies
- Provide automated rollback capability for any release

### MUST NOT DO

- Deploy to production with unresolved critical/high CVEs
- Skip security code review for "urgent" fixes (emergency patches still require review)
- Use `*` or `latest` tags for production dependencies
- Merge code with SAST ERROR severity findings without security team approval
- Communicate vulnerabilities externally without internal coordination
- Apply security patches to major versions without full regression testing
- Disable quality gates in any environment (development除外, with logging)
- Accept security warnings without documented justification and approval

## Output Template

When implementing a secure release pipeline, ensure the following components are included:

1. **Pipeline Configuration**
   - CI/CD pipeline definitions (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
   - All security scanning tools configured with severity thresholds
   - Automated blocking on critical security issues

2. **Security Policy Document**
   - Dependency scanning requirements (tools, frequency, thresholds)
   - Code review requirements (SAST, peer review for sensitive code)
   - Version management policy (semantic versioning rules)
   - Quality gate criteria (blocking vs warning, approval workflow)

3. **Incident Response Playbook**
   - Severity classification criteria
   - Response time SLAs for each severity level
   - Communication protocols (internal and external)
   - Post-incident review process

4. **Automation Scripts**
   - Dependency scanning integration scripts
   - Security gate validation scripts
   - Version management and auto-bumping utilities
   - Incident logging and tracking tools

5. **Documentation**
   - How to run security scans locally
   - How to approve warning-level issues
   - How to handle security incidents
   - Version management decision tree
