# IAM (Identity and Access Management)

Configure fine-grained identity and access management with users, roles, policies, and MFA for secure, least-privilege access across all AWS services.

## TL;DR Checklist

- [ ] Create dedicated IAM roles for each workload/service
- [ ] Apply principle of least privilege to all policies
- [ ] Never use root account for daily operations
- [ ] Enable MFA for all human users
- [ ] Use cross-account roles for multi-account architectures
- [ ] Implement service roles for EC2, Lambda, RDS
- [ ] Enforce assume role conditions (IP, time-based)
- [ ] Monitor role usage with CloudTrail
- [ ] Audit unused roles and permissions regularly
- [ ] Use resource-based policies for cross-service access

---

## When to Use

Use IAM when:

- Managing access to AWS resources for users and services
- Implementing least-privilege security model
- Building multi-account architectures
- Enabling federated access (SAML, OIDC)
- Delegating permissions to applications and EC2 instances
- Implementing role-based access control (RBAC)

---

## When NOT to Use

Avoid IAM for:

- Authenticating applications (use Cognito instead)
- Managing database users (use database-native auth)
- Application-level authorization (implement in application code)

---

## Purpose and Use Cases

**Primary Purpose:** Provide centralized identity and access management for AWS resources with fine-grained, least-privilege permissions.

**Common Use Cases:**

1. **User Access Control** — Grant developers, ops, and admins appropriate permissions
2. **Cross-Account Access** — Enable one account to access resources in another
3. **Service-to-Service Auth** — EC2, Lambda, ECS access other AWS services
4. **Federated Access** — SAML/OIDC integration with corporate directories
5. **API Authentication** — Programmatic access with access keys
6. **Role-Based Access** — Different permissions for different teams/functions

  # Developer Access Role (to be assumed)
  DeveloperAccessRole:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
    Properties:
      RoleName: developer-access-role
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Version: '2012-10-17'
        Statement:
          - Effect: Allow
            Principal:
              AWS: !Sub 'arn:aws:iam::${AWS::AccountId}:root'
            Action: sts:AssumeRole
            Condition:
              Bool:
                aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent: 'true'

  # Developer permissions
  DeveloperPermissions:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Policy
    Properties:
      PolicyName: developer-permissions
      Roles:
        - !Ref DeveloperAccessRole
      PolicyDocument:
        Version: '2012-10-17'

            Resource: '*'
          - Sid: EC2ManageDevInstances
            Effect: Allow
            Action:
              - ec2:RunInstances
              - ec2:TerminateInstances
              - ec2:RebootInstances
            Resource: 
              - arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*
            Condition:
              StringEquals:
                aws:ResourceTag/Environment: 'development'
```

**Key Elements:**
- User and group management
- MFA required for sensitive actions
- Role assumption requires MFA authentication
- Self-service MFA device management
- Environment-based resource access control

## Integration Approaches

### 1. Integration with Federated Identity

IAM + SAML/OIDC enables:
- Corporate directory integration (Active Directory, Okta)
- Single sign-on (SSO)
- Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning
- Simplified user lifecycle management

### 2. Integration with Security Token Service (STS)

STS provides:
- Temporary credentials for role assumption
- Cross-account access
- SAML/OIDC federation
- Token duration control

### 3. Integration with CloudTrail

IAM + CloudTrail provides:
- API call auditing
- User activity tracking
- Compliance investigation
- Security incident response

### 4. Integration with AWS Organizations

Organizations + IAM enables:
- Centralized policy management
- Service control policies (SCPs)
- Cross-account automation
- Hierarchical access control

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Using Root Account for Daily Operations

**Problem:** Root has unrestricted access; if compromised, entire account is at risk.

**Solution:**
- Create dedicated IAM admin user with MFA
- Lock away root account credentials
- Use MFA for root account (enable CloudTrail monitoring)
- Never share root credentials

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Overly Permissive Policies

**Problem:** Wildcard permissions violate least-privilege; increase blast radius of compromise.

**Solution:**
- Use specific resource ARNs instead of wildcards
- Grant only actions needed for function
- Use resource tags to scope permissions
- Regular policy audits and cleanup

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Long-Lived Access Keys

**Problem:** Static access keys cannot be rotated; if exposed, compromise persists.

**Solution:**
- Use temporary credentials via role assumption
- Rotate access keys every 90 days
- Use IAM Access Analyzer to find unused credentials
- Monitor access key usage in CloudTrail

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Missing MFA

**Problem:** Password compromise alone grants access; no second factor.

**Solution:**
- Enforce MFA for all human users
- Require MFA for sensitive actions (IAM, billing)
- Hardware keys for highest security
- U2F for phishing resistance

### ❌ Pitfall 5: Hardcoded Credentials

**Problem:** Credentials in code can be accidentally committed; exposed in repositories.

**Solution:**
- Use IAM roles instead of access keys
- Store secrets in Secrets Manager
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Scan code for credential patterns

### ❌ Pitfall 6: No Access Review Process

**Problem:** Users accumulate permissions over time; orphaned accounts still have access.

**Solution:**
- Regular access reviews (quarterly minimum)
- Use IAM Access Analyzer to find unused resources
- Document role purposes and required permissions
- Automate permission cleanup

## Best Practices Summary

| Category | Best Practice |
|---|---|
| **Principle of Least Privilege** | Grant only required permissions; deny by default |
| **Role-Based Access** | Use roles instead of attaching policies to users |
| **MFA** | Enforce for human users and sensitive operations |
| **Credentials** | Use temporary credentials; rotate access keys quarterly |
| **Auditing** | Enable CloudTrail; review access regularly |
| **Cross-Account** | Use roles + external IDs for secure delegation |
